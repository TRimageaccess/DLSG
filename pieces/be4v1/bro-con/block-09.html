Traffic lights use three colors that are highly distinct from each other so that there is no ambiguity to the human eye.
This kind of distinction is not possible when the goal is to produce the greatest likeness to the original as possible.
Archive quality scanners must capture such high spatial and chromatic detail that they naturally capture 'noise', along with the image being scanned. 
To reduce the 'noise' that is introduced by even the best CCD electronics, Image Access has painstakingly profiled the added 'noise' versus 'real data' curve for its CCDs. 
This added noise is then eliminated, resulting in significantly more accurate representations of the original objects.
