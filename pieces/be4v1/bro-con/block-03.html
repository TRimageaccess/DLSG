<h1 class="block-title">Better Image Quality</h1>
<p>
When given the opportunity to compare the image quality of several competing scanners outputting the same resolution or dpi, it's likely that you will notice variations in quality like the ones below. 
These variations result from the effects of differences in scanner optics, electronics and lighting. 
One Western European nation purchased 80 scanners from Image Access based on its superior image quality, even though the competing scanners offered the same resolution.
