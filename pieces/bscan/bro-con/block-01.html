<p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0105">In the early days of digital interlibrary loan and digital
document delivery, the available software was simple and
image quality expectations of requestors were low. Times
have changed. The demand for faster workflow delivery and
perfect, printer-ready images has made the current software
environment complex, creating significant challenges in
training new employees. BSCAN ILL simplifies existing
processes and produces perfect, printer-ready images.

<p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0106">BSCAN ILL starts by eliminating the need to manually enter
requestor information. BSCAN ILL automatically reads the

only saving time but also
eliminating human error.

<p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0108">Articles are scanned using one of a family of high speed
face-up scanners: Click Mini, Click, and Bookeye 4 V3, V2
& V1. By eliminating the constant book flipping required
by flatbed scanners, these face-up scanners are three to
five times faster than the fastest face-down scanners, and
they do not cause book spine damage. For low volume
ILL operations, BSCAN ILL also runs BookEdge flatbed
scanners, employing their book edge feature and a faster
mode that scans two pages at a time.

<p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0109">Once articles are scanned, BSCAN ILL's powerful image
treatment capabilities automatically eliminate skew and
remove unwanted black borders, fan and gutter.
</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0110">Finally, BSCAN ILL automatically sends requests through
ILLiad/Odyssey, Ariel, RAPID, Clio, Article Exchange,
Relais, FTP, and e-mail and can notifiy ILLiad/Odyssey
in each case, all without any need for further human
intervention. Resending articles is also a snap.
