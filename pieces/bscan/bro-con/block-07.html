<h1 class="block-title" id="ILL-0701">Resource Sharing</h1>
<h3 class="block-title3" id="ILL-0702">Share with Archivist & Digital Course Materials Creation</h3>

<p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0703">The exceptional image quality produced by Bookeye and
WideTEK scanners affords opportunities for resource shar-
ing with Archivists as well as use for projects and creat-<br>
ing digital course materials. Reduce your cost per article
scanned by sharing equipment costs and helping other
departments to switch to digital format and get color content
without the additional cost of color copiers or color micro-
filming.</p> 

<p class="block_text2" id="ILL-0704">Use some digitization projects funding<br>
to purchase the Bookeye<br>
4 V1, V2 or V3 and dramatically<br>
reduce ILL's share of the cost<br>
of state-of-the-art scanning<br>
equipment. A complementary schedule<br>
is usually easy to agree upon. Note that while the<br>
Bookeye 4 V2's standard image quality (high quality<br>
400dpi) meets and exceeds digitization standards, a<br>
600dpi option can be purchased later, if desired.</p> 

<p class="block_text3" id="ILL-0705">BSCAN ILL automatically locates the content and sets consistent margins,<br>
removes fan, gutter and black edges - and even deskews the image.</p> 

<p class="block_text3" id="ILL-0706">Avoid the poor results that<br>
photocopiers & microfilming<br>
too often produce.</p> 

<h1 class="block-title2" id="ILL-0707">The Amazing Image Quality of the Bookeye 4 V2 600dpi Option</h1>
<h3 class="block-title4" id="ILL-0708">With its 600dpi option, Bookeye 4 V2 produces the highest quality A2 size (17x25'') images of any face-up scanner today</h3>

<p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0709">To capture moving objects, digital cameras must use array CCDs,
which capture all parts of the object at the same instant. Afford-<br>
able digital cameras have 50 megapixels or less. And those pixels
must be further divided into red, green and blue sub-pixels, which
can reduce the clarity of color images by 40%.</p> 

<p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0710">Since books don't move while being scanned, Bookeyes employ
linear CCD technology to produce ultra-clear images with astounding 140 megapixels. 
Each pixel in a linear CCD includes full red, green and blue sub-pixels.</p> 

<p class="block_text6" id="ILL-0711">Scanners use linear CCDs. The sweep-<br>
ing action of scanners allow them to<br>
capture the precise amount of red, blue<br>
and green for each pixel.</p> 

<p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0712">Bookeye 4 scanners utilize a unique state-of-the-art rotating mirror
system that dramatically reduces clarity loss at the corners of the
image due to the limitations of lens systems. Bookeyes can also
scan in V-mode or flat-mode, and they scan from left to right, allowing them to follow the curves of the book.</p>

digital cameras to capture color images</p>
