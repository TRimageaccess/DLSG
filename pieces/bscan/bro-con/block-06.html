and Scanners</h2>

<p class="block_text2" id="ILL-0609">Face up scanners minimize book jockeying. Fast face-up</p>
<p class="block_text2" id="ILL-0610">scanners like those offered by DLSG with BSCAN ILL are 3-5
times faster than the fastest face-down scanners and photo- 
copiers. And unlike face-down scanners and copiers, DLSG
scanners are designed to capture deep into the book fold, flat-
ten book curve, split images into two pages and remove fan and
gutter.</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="ILL-0611">BookEdge is uniquely designed for scanning books and is</p>
<p class="block_text2" id="ILL-0612">the fastest face-down scanner in its price range. When used in
book mode (one page at a time), this scanner flattens the page
and captures deep into the fold of tightly bound journals. With
BSCAN ILL, the BookEdge can also be used to scan 2 pages
at a time, which is substantially faster than book mode. BSCAN
ILL splits & flattens the pages, and eliminates fan, gutter & skew.</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="ILL-0613">Older technologies like photocopiers and face-down scan-</p>
<p class="block_text2" id="ILL-0614">ners are concomitant with limitations that typically include:</p>

<ul class="bullet" id="ILL-0615">
 <li>Difficulty Capturing Content in the Book Fold</li>
 <li>Significant Stress to Book Spines</li>
 <li>Limit to 11x17 inch Scan Area</li>
 <li>Black & White Paper Copies instead of Full-Color, Digital
Copies</li> 
 <li>Unsightly Skew, Fan, Gutter, & Black Borders</li>
 <li>Significantly Higher Cost of Operation</li>
</ul>
