<h1 class="block-title" id="ILL-0210">BSCAN ILL<br>
Dramatically Improves ILL Digitization</h1>

<p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0211">A fundamental tenet that has always bound the academic
research community together is open sharing of newfound
knowledge. Today, this open sharing is going on at a feverish
pace and digital interlibrary loan services are an essential vehicle.
Scholars from all fields are becoming increasingly dependent
on their ability to acquire journal articles in just one day.</p>

<p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0212">In the early 1990s, the pioneers of interlibrary loan digitization
had no choice but to adapt commercial scanning equipment
to meet their needs. Ariel was the only available document
delivery software and there were no scanners made
specifically for scanning books, journals and maps. Over
time, that changed. Planetary scanners became available in
the late 1990s. The first release of BSCAN ILL automatically
read (using OCR) the requestor information from pull slips
without manual keying, supported rapid scanning and image
cleanup, and automatically posted to Ariel with the press of a
single button. Since then, ILLiad, Odyssey, Ariel, RAPID, Clio
and Article Exchange have been integrated into BSCAN ILL
with the same hands-off automation. BSCAN ILL has a host
of valuable features, many of which are not available with any
other system.</p>

<p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0213">In addition to allowing review of electronic articles and resource
sharing to reduce per article scanning costs (e.g. for archival,
electronic course materials creation, scanning projects), only
BSCAN ILL offers you:</p>

<div class="greencheck">
<p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0214">One easy user interface, integrated seamlessly with Article
Exchange, ILLiad/Odyssey, RAPID, Relais, Ariel, Clio, FTP & Email<br>
- reduces training time significantly</p>
<p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0215">Optimized for the latest technology in face-up scanners, including all
Bookeye models, Click, Click Mini, and face-down scanners such as
BookEdge and WideTEK 25</p>
<p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0216">Automatically reading of requestor information from pull slips</p>
<p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0217">Automatically sending without intervention by the scan operator</p> 
<p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0218">Central management with central, portable and remote scanning</p> 
<p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0219">Automatic hold of all scanned articles for up to 30 days for fast<br>
correcting and easy resending</p> 
<p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0220">Automatic updating of ILLiad/Odyssey, even if the request was
delivered by another means such as Ariel, Relais, Clio, FTP or email</p> 
<p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0221">Automatic image cleanup and output of 'printer-ready' images</p>

to use a face-down scanner to scan multiple pages.</p>

<p class="block_text6" id="ILL-0232">In contrast, the sequence on the left shows the relative speed
and ease of face-up scanning systems that do not require
the user to flip over the book being scanned. Once placing
the book, the user simply turns pages and presses the scan
button (or foot pedal) to scan two pages at a time.</p>
