<h1 class="block-title2" id="ILL-0810">Premium Maintenance Plan</h1>
<p class="block_text3" id="ILL-0811">Image Access has an unmatched service and support
record. It is impossible to affordably provide service
personnel living in every city and town across America
that are highly trained on the very special technologies
needed by libraries. Instead, DLSG designs remote ser-
viceability into its products and has perfected remote di-
agnosis and when possible, repair.</p> 
<p class="block_text3" id="ILL-0812">The resulting savings allows
DLSG to frequently and promptly
provide loaner/swap-out equip-
ment and to go on site whenever
necessary to maintain and repair</p> 
<p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0813">equipment, minimizing
interruptions in service.</p> 

<h1 class="block-title3" id="ILL-0814">Company History</h1>

<p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0815">Our experience in digitization of printed materials dates back to 1988 prior to its founding<br>
in 1993, when Image Access began providing digitization workflow solutions to commercial<br>
markets. Having developed its own book and wide format scanners as well as its own OCR,<br>
barcode reading and image treatment algorithms and a powerful workflow system, Image Access<br>
is well-equipped to meet both general and specialized digitization needs.</p>
<p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0816">Image Access has a long history of leadership in digital technology. Image Access created Scan2Net&reg;,<br>
the first Ethernet/HTML based scanner interface, the first self-serve book scanner kiosk, the first and<br>
only ILL scan, clean-up and delivery workflow system, the first affordable preservation quality large<br>
format planetary scanner, the first affordable duplex newspaper scanner, the first and only book scanner<br>
with both flat and v-modes, the first and only complete digitization workflow system, and more. We also<br>
have the most extensive and prestigious customer list for book scanners in the United States and many<br>
countries abroad.</p>
<p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0817">Image Access created the Digital Library Systems Group (DLSG) in 2004 to focus on the special needs<br>
of academic, research and public libraries. And just as Bookeye quickly became the leading book<br>
scanner, DLSG quickly became the leading supplier of hybrid library products in America, helping the<br>
most prestigious libraries across America become Digital Age Libraries.</p>
<p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0818">Image Access has, by far, the largest selection of self-serve book scanners (KIC), the only complete<br>
turnkey digitization workflow system for creating digital assets and archiving (Opus), and the only<br>
complete Interlibrary loan scanning and image treatment workflow system (BSCAN ILL). Image<br>
Access handily succeeds at its ongoing mission of providing the best image quality, the most<br>
specialized software and the broadest line of digitization products from which a library,<br>
archive or museum can choose.</p>
