<h2 class="block-title" id="ILL-0501">Automatic Image Treatment</h2>

<p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0502">BSCAN ILL automatically locates the content on each<br>
page, clips the content, creates a preset margin for<br>
consistency, and deskews and corrects curvature<br>
when necessary. When completed, the treated article<br>
images are passed on to the manual review stage.</p>


<h2 class="block-title" id="ILL-0503">Manual Review & Correction</h2>

<p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0504">This stage can be run after each article is scanned, or<br>
for greater efficiency, several articles can be scanned<br>
in sequence, automatically treated, queued up in this<br>
stage and reviewed at one time.</p>

<h2 class="block-title" id="ILL-0505">Send & Route</h2>

<p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0506">Each article is automatically sent via the<br>
delivery method specified. If an ILL de-<br>
partment is using ILLiad and Odyssey to<br>
track completion and perform billing-relat-<br>
ed operations, BSCAN ILL can be config-<br>
ured to notify Odyssey that the article was<br>
sent even if it wasn't sent by Odyssey.</p>

<h2 class="block-title" id="ILL-0507">Resend</h2>
<p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0508">BSCAN ILL is capable of storing</p>
<p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0509">articles for a configurable number of</p>
<p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0510">days after they're sent. If an article must be</p>
<p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0511">resent, it can be opened and sent right away or be</p>
<p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0512">edited first, for example by adding or deleting pages.</p>
