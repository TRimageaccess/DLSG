<h2 class="block-title" id="ILL-0303">Three Things You Should Know About ILL Digitization Equipment</h2>

<h3 class="block-title3" id="ILL-0304">SPEED</h3>
<p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0305">All of the systems that DLSG bundles with<br>
BSCAN ILL are quite fast, but our face up<br>
scanners are the fastest. By eliminating<br>
the need to flip the volume repeatedly, our<br>
face-up scanners are up to 5 times faster<br>
than the fastest face-down scanners.</p>

<h3 class="block-title3" id="ILL-0306">ONGOING</h3>
<h3 class="block-title3" id="ILL-0307">SUPPORT & SERVICES</h3>
<p class="block_text2" id="ILL-0308">Digitization for ILL and digital document de- 
livery are production processes. It is impor- 
tant that they be backed by a reliable vendor
team, and Image Access has an unmatched
service and support record.</p>

<h3 class="block-title3" id="ILL-0309">CAPTURING CONTENT DEEP INTO THE BOOK FOLD</h3>
<p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0310">Never Fail an Article Request Again</p>

<h3 class="block-title4" id="ILL-0311">Bookeye Method</h3>
<p class="block_text3" id="ILL-0312">Bookeyes follow the<br>
natural curve of the book<br>
when they scan. Good<br>
lighting is essential for<br>
good scanning, and<br>
Bookeye 4 scanners em-<br> 
ploy two white LED light<br>
bars that sweep across<br>
the material.</p>

<h3 class="block-title4" id="ILL-0313">Click Method</h3>
<p class="block_text3" id="ILL-0314">Click captures the left and<br>
right pages with two separate<br>
cameras positioned at ideal<br>
angles.<br>
An array of 420 individu-<br>
ally aimed white LED lights<br>
produce bright, evenly distrib-<br>
uted illumination from above<br>
and behind the scan bed,<br>
thus avoiding reflection.</p>

<h3 class="block-title4" id="ILL-0315">BookEdge Method</h3>
<p class="block_text3" id="ILL-0316">The BookEdge is a<br>
flatbed scanner with a<br>
specialized feature that<br>
easily captures close<br>
into the bookfold<br>
without damaging<br>
the spine.
