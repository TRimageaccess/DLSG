The WideTEK 36 DS is the world's first wide format scanner for duplex digitization of newspapers and other double-sided printed documents up to 36 inches (915 mm) in width. 
This compact device needs only four seconds to scan the front and back sides of a newspaper page (at 300 dpi).

<p>
The idea of double-sided scanning in one production step primarily means less production effort: 
The document no longer needs to be flipped over and scanned again on the other side. 
That makes the scanner an ideal companion for press clipping, archiving and library services.
</p>
<p>
The scanner features two camera boxes, both consisting of three CCD systems, integrated into the upper and lower part of the device - only a few inches from each other. 
The WideTEK 36 DS captures both sides of the newspaper at the same time. After scanning, software separates the scanned document into four single images; 
capturing the left and right sides on the front and back of the newspaper - all in a single step.

<p>
The scanner is equipped with two processor units. 
This allows an extremely fast data throughput. 
The patented stitching procedure and the optical resolution of 1200 x 600 dpi guarantee brilliant scan results.
</p>
<p>
The mechanical construction of the WideTEK 36 DS is also a highlight. 
The more extensive mechanics and additional camera and light units were integrated into the device without dramatically enlarging its dimensions. 
The duplex scanner is only 13 centimetres larger than the compact WideTEK 36.
</p>
<p>
The complete camera optical system is integrated in a hermetically sealed housing. 
Once optimally adjusted, it remains stable, dust-free and requires virtually no maintenance.
</p>
<p>
Special transport rollers, with individually spring loaded ball bearing pairs serving as pressure points; ensure the best possible gentle document transport. 
WideTEK 36 DS digitizes even historical and fragile documents without damage to the source document.
