Optical components are encapsulated in Bookeye's dust-free, hermetically sealed camera box for dust-free and quiet operation. 
What's more is that no consumables are required for continual operation.

<p>
In addition to their higher speed and larger than normal bed sizes, the 600 dpi optical resolution of Bookeye scanners meets and exceeds the recommendations established in the Report on the Meeting of Experts on Digital Preservation by the U. S. Government Printing Office in 2005. 
This makes them an ideal resource within such high production workflow areas as: 
InterLibrary Loan; Digital Archive &amp; Preservation; Museums; Historical Societies &amp; Genealogy organizations; National, State and Local government offices, as well as the most demanding commercial applications.
