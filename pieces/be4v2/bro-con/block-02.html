Bookeye scanners have remained at the peak of the performance curve for serious production scanners for more than 15 years. 
They are relied upon worldwide as much for their speed and durability as for the beautiful 24-bit color images they produce at true preservation quality 600 dpi resolution.
</p>
<p>
That tradition of technology leadership continues with the Bookeye 4 and its revolutionary new large format V-cradle scanner, which uses linear CCD technology to produce large format images in true 600dpi clarity.
Images produced by the Bookeye 4 are equivalent to what a 148 megapixel digital camera would produce in black and white, if such a camera existed. 
The most advanced professional digital camera-based scanning systems, which cost four times more than Bookeye 4, produce less B&amp;W (grayscale) image data and

therefore less clarity. 
The Bookeye 4 produces 445 million bytes of raw, uncompressed image data - that's over four times more color data than those costly systems. 
The result is dramatically higher clarity.
</p>
<p>
One secret behind Bookeye 4's superior quality images is that it employs a linear CCD with dual reflecting mirrors that move instead of the lens; 
all but eliminating distortions inherent with both film and digital cameras (e.g. chromatic aberrations, barrel and pincushion distortions). 
Another reason for Bookeye 4's superior image quality is that the lens always remains perfectly perpendicular to the book whether in the flat or 'V' position, thereby enabling the scanner to digitize each side of the book in perfect alignment. 
The end result is a scanner that captures documents precisely from edge to edge while gently preserving the subject matter.
