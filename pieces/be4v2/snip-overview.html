   With this latest member of the Bookeye&reg; family, Image Access placed an emphasis on developing a scanner which is compact, easy to operate and competitively priced; 
   to bring high end professional scanning to an even larger population of users. 
   The efficient Bookeye&reg; 4 digitizes source material such as bound documents at high speeds in up to 600 dpi optical resolution and formats up to DIN A2.
  </P>
  <P>
   Over 17 years of electronic, optical and mechanical engineering experience went into the creation and manufacture of the Bookeye&reg; 4. 
   The clever mirror mechanism captures the document precisely from edge to edge, whether it is a flat document or a book open at an angle of 120 degrees.
  </P>
  <P>
   The V-shaped book cradle was optimized to reduce the risk of damage to book spines and binding during digitization. 
   The book cradle holds the open book at an angle of 120 degrees; 
   enough to effectively scan the contents of a page, while gently preserving the original subject matter.

   Bookeye&reg; 4 V2 has all the advantages of a more expensive standalone device. 
   Outfitted with an integrated color touchscreen and monitor, Bookeye&reg; 4 can reach unrivaled scanning speeds and process large volumes of data independent of any external peripheral devices - a typical feature of all Image Access scanners.
  </P>
  <p>
   It takes approximately 1.6 seconds for the Bookeye&reg; 4 to capture and process the images of two pages of a DIN A2 sized book scanned at 200 dpi optical resolution. 
   Once the image is on the screen, modifications can be made to scan parameters such as brightness, color or contrast without having to rescan. 
   Users operate the system intuitively, guided by clear and well-structured menu commands on the touchscreen. 
   Scanned images can be saved to a USB flash drive or Cloud, sent via email, printed on a connected or network printer, or uploaded to an FTP Server.

  <p>
   Bookeye&reg; 4 V2's solid build, innovative features and competitive pricing make it an ideal book copier for large groups of users; for example, in a university library. 
   Some of the advantages of using a Bookeye&reg; 4 instead of a standard copier include the Bookeye&reg;'s built-in book cradle for gently handling bound materials, its speed 
   and simplicity of operation, and the fact that the resulting digital images substantially reduce, and in most cases eliminate, the need to print scanned material.
