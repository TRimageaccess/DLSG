<H2 class="product-tab mint">MORE FEATURES</H2>
<div class="product-tab"><P><span class="feature-label">High Speed Scanning:</span> Image Access scanners always run at rated speeds regardless of how powerful your computer is. We do a full scan into the scanner memory at full speed, without any stops. We're the only scanner company that does that. Only the time between scanning and output are dependent upon the transfer speed of the network and the computer, and even our transfer rate is twice as fast as competing products because data is transferred to your workstation at 1 Gigabit speeds, while other scanners use significantly slower transfer rates (1/2 Gigabit or less). <a href="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/docs/WhitePaper_Scanning_Speed.pdf">Learn more</a></p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><P><span class="feature-label">Works Well With Others:</span> Create JPEG, PDF (both searchable and image-only), or TIFF file formats and save to network (PC, server, FTP).</p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><P><span class="feature-label">Easy to Use:</span> Single button scanning, optional foot pedal, built-in display, automatic laser-assisted profile detection and automatic format recognition ensure uncompromised scan results.</p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><P><span class="feature-label">High Duty Cycle:</span> Bookeye scanners are designed for high-volume, professional use. Their duty cycles far exceed that of desktop scanners.</p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><P><span class="feature-label">Clear, Crisp, Colorful Scans:</span>Clear, Crisp, Colorful Scans: Fast scanning in B&W, grayscale and color, high-quality resolution of up to 400 dpi. We've made it our business for over 15 years now to be experts in image resolution, and since there is some confusion among users regarding this matter, we've provided a white paper that debunks some longstanding myths. <a href="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/docs/WhitePaper_The_Resolution_Myth.pdf">Learn more</a></p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><P><span class="feature-label">State of the Art Illumination:</span>State of the Art Illumination: Bookeye's bright white LED illumination lasts significantly longer than other lighting systems. LED lights also consume less power and produce far less heat. </p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><P><span class="feature-label">Easy Setup:</span> Bookeye scanners connect over your network using standard IP (Internet Protocol) addresses and can be operated by a standard browser without drivers or add-on cards.</p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><P><span class="feature-label">No Warm Up Time:</span> Bookeye scanners are ready to scan anytime you are. Other scanners can require several minutes to warm up before use.</p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><P><span class="feature-label">Room to Grow:</span> Firmware upgrades are available online and are directly downloadable to the Bookeye using a standard browser.</P></DIV>
<div class="product-tab"><P><span class="feature-label">Environmentally Responsible:</span> We all know that scanning and saving images to email, USB, etc., rather than photocopying or printing saves paper and toner, but it's hard to get a feel for just how much savings are likely. <a href="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/docs/MIT%20DOCUMENT%20SERVICES%202005-2006%20ANNUAL%20REPORT.pdf">Click here</a> to see an annual report from MIT describing their savings. </P></DIV>
<div class="product-tab"><P><span class="feature-label">Remote Scanner Management:</span> You're in full control from any browser. Change any and all scanner settings remotely or using Bookeye's built-in touch screen.</P></DIV>
<div class="product-tab"><P><span class="feature-label">User Statistics Monitoring:</span> Bookeye lets you manage and monitor the usage, statistics and settings of each scanner you own. The reports are automatically uploaded and available online from your web browser.</P></DIV>
