 <h2 class="product-tab mint">Creative Technology. Fast Scans. Brilliant Results.</h2>
 <div class="product-tab"><P>For more than 13 years, the Bookeye&#174; brand has been recognized worldwide as a synonym for gentle digitization of valuable books. With their overhead scanning methodology, Bookeyes scan subject matter right side up.</P></div>
 <div class="product-tab"><P>Combined with a motorized book cradle, integrated glass plate and LED illumination, the Bookeye&#174; 3 is ideal for capturing bound documents, e.g. books, valuable scripts, folders, drawings, plans and much more.</P></div>
 <div class="product-tab"><P>Documents remain in their "natural" state on the scan surface. They do not need to be unbound, separated or carefully positioned. The automatic book fold correction effectively reduces annoying shadows and distortions of thick bound documents.</P></div>
 <div class="product-tab"><P>The operator preserves the original document and achieves optimal reproduction quality. An optional book holder supports extremely fragile books. Gray scale units can be upgraded to color after purchase.</P></div>
 <div class="product-tab"><P>Bookeye&#174; 3 is an efficient solution distinguished by high scan speed, durable lamps and nearly no consumables; guaranteeing efficient production with a quick return on investment. Bookeye&#174; 3 includes several first of its kind technological advancements such as laser-assisted profile detection and high performance LED illumination along with precise scan lenses and CCD image sensors to set new standards in scanning speed and quality.</P></div>

 <h2 class="product-tab mint">Motorized Book Cradle is Gentle on Delicate Materials</h2>
 <div class="product-tab"><P>The Bookeye&#174; 3 book scanner is outfitted with a motorized book cradle that includes three types of adjustment controls. With the press of a button, the adjustable cradle plates bring both sides of an open book to the same level, directly under the glass plate, allowing the camera to capture the document with optimal clarity.</P></div>
 <div class="product-tab"><P>The scan results are of a considerably higher quality than scanning without a book cradle. The cradle plates also optimally adjust to the width of the book's spine without exerting unnecessary pressure on the book.</P></div>
