Unlike copiers and flatbed scanners, the KIC Click&trade; allows users to digitize books face-up, without damaging books by having to press them hard against a glass plate. 
The Click&trade;'s lightening speed is derived as much from its fast opto-electronics as from the fact that its face-up design obviates the need to flip books over and over again during the digitization process.
