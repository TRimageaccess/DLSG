   When people see the new KIC Click&trade; for the first time, the most common expression is "it's so beautiful."  
   And with True2Touch, it's as easy to use as it is beautiful. 
   Are there any compromises? You decide.

   The KIC Click&trade; captures book content as fast as 1 page per second! 
   With a bed size 30% larger than its nearest competitor, it captures up to 21x16 inch books and materials at an uncompromising resolution of 300dpi.

   Photocopiers, PCs, monitors and keyboards clutter up otherwise beautiful libraries across America. 
   The smooth, triple-layer, pearlescent white KIC Click&trade; totally reverses that trend. 
   It adds beauty to the most beautiful libraries. 
   Inspired by an outstanding effort of the fledgling tablet industry to turn technology into something more like jewelry or a fashion accessory than a computer, the pearlescent KIC Click&trade; evokes comments like, "We care about the appearance of our library and this machine is over the top!"

   The KIC Click&trade; perfectly completes the KIC family of self-serve digitizing systems. 
   The KIC Bookeye 4 has the most durable production book scanner, the only book scanner with both V-cradle and flat modes, and the highest quality 600dpi of any scanner. 
   The KIC Click&trade; is small, fast and beautiful, and the KIC BookEdge is cheaper than most floor standing black-and-white photocopiers. 
   And since none of them use toner or paper, they're environmentally friendly and ultimately far cheaper to run than copiers.
