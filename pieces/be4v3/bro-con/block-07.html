At a Gigabit per second, the Bookeye scanner's Ethernet interface is twice as fast as USB 2.0 and is the fastest available today. 
This is important because grayscale and color images can be very large and take a long time to transfer. 
With Bookeye scanners, transfering images to the PC is typically fast enough that, by the time the scan operator has placed the next document on the scanner, the transfer is already completed and the scanner can begin scanning the next image. 
In these cases (usually at 300dpi and lower),

transfer times have no effect on the overall scanning throughput and instead, the overall throughput is limited by the scan operator. 
However, at 600dpi and without compression, transfer times can become a factor. 
The figures above show scan sweep time separately from transfer time so that the transfer time can be compared with the expected time to turn to the next page or move to the next document or object to be scanned, and the overall throughput can be estimated more accurately.
