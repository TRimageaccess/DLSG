<h2 class="list-head"> Scan2Net Interface Speed </h2>
<p>
Since Scan2Net scanners connect to computers via Gigabit Ethernet, their data transfer speeds are substantially higher than any other scanners on the market. 
This high speed is vital for performance when scanning large images at high resolutions. 
For optimal speed, connect the scanner directly to the computer using the Ethernet crossover cable supplied with the scanner.
