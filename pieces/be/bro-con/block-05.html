<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0501">No More Book Spine Damage!</h2>
<p class="block_text2" id="BE-0502">Thick books with stiff spines and content that runs deep into the
bookfold are often damaged when copied. KIC BookEdge eas-
ily captures content well into the bookfold without damaging the</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="BE-0503">spine. Black edges are au-
tomatically removed and
the content is straightened,
producing clean, profes-
sional looking images -
important for electronic re-
serves, course curriculum
materials and research re-
ports. These automatic im-
age treatment functions also
save a lot of faculty, admin-
istrator, and student time.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0504">Compact & Affordable</h2>
<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0505">The KIC BookEdge is the perfect choice for student walk-up
scanning and copying in areas where space is a premium. It
makes entire library collections available in digital form. The
KIC BookEdge's clever design allows users to scan pages right
up to the bound margin near the spine, without damaging books.
The KIC BookEdge produces beautiful, full-color images at no
additional cost over black & white images! Even searchable PDF's
and text-to-audio (MP3 files) are a snap to create.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0506">The KIC BookEdge was specifically designed to occupy the
same space as a typical floor-standing photocopier. Replacing
outmoded copiers in academic and research libraries is easy
with KIC BookEdge's modern scanning, printing and interactive
computerized touch screen technology. The optional ADF scanner
and a printer gives the KIC BookEdge the functionality of a color
copier at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0510">Compatible with Copy Card<br>
& Cash Systems</h2>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0511">All KIC systems are compatible with all standard
copy card and coin-op devices. Since KIC trans- fers
images to users' computers electronically,
costly expendables are avoided, even for color!
The library can opt to keep all revenue it collects.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0512">Charge for Prints Only...</h2>

<p class="block_text5" id="BE-0513">or charge more for prints, less for images. When it comes to
cost recovery, KIC systems have got you covered. KIC's fee
administration feature lets you charge different amounts for
color, B&W, 8.5 x 11" and 11 x 17" images.</p>

<p class="block_text7" id="BE-0519">New models from major system vendors are supported as they become available</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0520">Digital copiers are very mature products that certainly have their
place in business and administration environments, but not the
library floor. With its book edge feature that protects the spines
of books, its ADF option that scans one or both sides of 20 loose-
leaf pages per minute, and a generic high-speed printer, KIC
gives new meaning to the phrase 'copiers are so old school.'
When compaired with copiers and MFCs, KIC book scanners are
the only intelligent choice for the library floor.</p>
