<h1 class="block-title2" id="BE-0601">True 2 Touch<span class="superscript">TM</span> User Interface</h1>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0604">Ease-of-use is a central feature of KIC. KIC BookEdge's large touch screen and its large "Scan" and
"Save, Send or Print" buttons that occupy a very large portion of the touch screen clearly convey how
easy KIC is to use. The Save button defaults to an output method and file format that is selectable by
the institution. If a flash drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate
that it will save to the flash drive. Users can override the default output method by manually selecting
one or more other methods of output.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0605">KIC BookEdge's smart design includes the</p>
<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0606">full KIC self-serve digitization functionality in a mere 25 inch
width. It's large, 22 inch touch screen and capture surface are
at the perfect heights when placed on a typical table or desktop.
The KIC BookEdge also has an optional matching "k-stand" for
freestanding operation.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0607">Both floorstanding and tabletop
system configurations have an optional SmartDock feature,
which provides a convenient place for the user's tablet,
notebook PC, or other smart device while scanning.</p>

 <li>Create full color electronic images and/or paper copies</li>
 <li>Review electronic images before saving or printing copies</li>
 <li>Collate by dragging images into proper order with your fingertip</li> 
 <li>Select file formats such as PDF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, even MP3 (audio)</li>
 <li>Simply place your smart device on KIC's optional SmartDock and with just two
touches, you are ready for very high-speed transfer.</li>
 <li>Sending scanned images via email is also fast and easy with hot-keys that are
pre-programmed with your institution's base email address.</li>
 <li>Output to Google Docs / Google Apps for Education and other cloud-based
tools can also be simplified with pre-programmed hot-keys.</li>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0610">KIC's True2Touch<span class="superscript2">TM</span> User Interface,
Especially Forgiving for Beginners</h2>

<ul class="peppermint2" id="BE-0611">
 <li>KIC is very agile, and allows the user to jump from just about anywhere
in the touch screen system to just about anywhere else, directly and
usually with a single touch. This modern, 'modeless' design is easier to
use, but difficult to create.</li>
 <li>KIC's large buttons and controls are easy to use, even for people with
unsteady hands.</li>
 <li>KIC gradually expands and contracts controls such as brightness, con- trast
and DPI so users can easliy follow their screen activity</li>
 <li>KIC doesn't delete original images when you clip a photo or excerpt of
text unless you tell it to.</li> 
 <li>KIC lets you output to many different destinations in a single session.</li>
 <li>Once you've scanned a document, you can change your mind as to
where you would like it to output. For example, you may have wanted
to save to USB, but learned your USB drive is full. Or you may scan
so much that it exceeds your email limit. Or after scanning and collating
a mass of research, you decide that you want to share the research
with others.</li>

<h1 class="block-title2" id="BE-0612">Two Large Screens for Simplicity & Power</h1>

<p class="block_text3" id="BE-0613">It's easy to undervalue screen size. For 20 years, all cellphone makers relent- lessly
pursued smaller and smaller screens until very recently when one com- pany
reversed that trend. They realized that people want the largest screen that
will fit in their pocket/purse and hand. This is because display screens are our
window to the digital world, and touch screens give us control over that world.</p>

<p class="block_text3" id="BE-0614">As big as self-serve scanning systems are, it makes sense to have a very large
touch screen. And with the low prices for high quality displays, it is compelling
to add a separate display screen. In 2002, DLSG realized this, when the first
KIC system was designed. Today, with nearly 10 years more experience than
any other vendor, DLSG has the most understandable, easy to use and powerful
user interface for self-serve book scanning, and it's based on dual screens.</p>

<p class="block_text3" id="BE-0615">The view screen shows very large, clear images of what you've scanned, allow- ing
the touch screen to have big, easy to understand buttons and other controls.</p>

<p class="block_text4" id="BE-0616">Display screens are our portals into the digital world, and
touch screens are the easiest way to control that world. That's
why DLSG provides large, 24 inch, full HD displays and
equally large touch screens with most of its KIC systems.</p>
