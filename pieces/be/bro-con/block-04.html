<h1 class="block-title2" id="BE-0401">KIC Bookeye vs. Copiers - How KIC Compares</h1>
<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0402">Copiers are Outmoded</h2>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0403">Since the first KIC was delivered to an academic library in 2004,
the days of photocopiers for patron use in academic libraries and
even public libraries were numbered. And now with the rapid ex-<br>
plosion of tablet computers and electronic readers, the demand
in academic libraries for electronic copies has substantially out-<br>
stripped the demand for printed copies. The demand for elec-<br>
tronic copies in public libraries is also reaching a tipping point.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0404">The ability to capture hundreds of pages of research into a tablet
or electronic reader and search through that material on the Inter-<br>
net with a tablet, eReader or notebook PC that can be used just
about anywhere is highly convenient and immensely valuable. In
this digital age, academic libraries are compelled to go hybrid for
three reasons: 1) the high demand for digital content; 2) their ex-<br>
isting print collections contain vast amounts of information that
cannot be found on the Internet; and 3) students are receptive to
the price of electronic copies - typically free.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0405">So how do the costs of KIC systems compare with those of photo
copiers? There are three main factors that keep the cost of photo-<br>
copies high: 1) each copy requires paper, toner and ink; 2) photo-</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0406">copiers require a lot of maintenance due
to the number of moving parts; and 3) all
major photocopier brands use a distributed
service model.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0407">In contrast, these costs are lower for KIC
because KIC has split the scan/copy
functions into three separate machines,
choosing the best of breed for each. As a
result, KIC offers the best book scanners
by themselves or with a loose-leaf paper
(ADF) scanner. Virtually any off-the-shelf
laser or inkjet printer can be added to any
KIC system, so you can optimize costs
and speeds, and offer affordable color.</p>

40 loose-leaf pages/min<br>
(20 sheets per minute)</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0409">Capture Area Comparison</h2>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0410">With a large 11.8 X 17 inch capture area, the KIC BookEdge system
has a maximum capture area that is 7% larger than large copiers
and more than twice the size of typical consumer scanners. The
image below shows the maximum scan areas of KIC products compared
to copiers and other book scanners.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0411">KIC Bookeye Scans 3 Times Faster</h2>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0412">Statistics from five million scanning sessions across America revealed
a median session length of 23 pages. So, most of the time
spent during a KIC session is spent scanning. Face up scanning
has been proven to be three times faster than face down scanning.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0413">KIC BookEdge Scanners vs. Copiers</h2>
<p class="block_text2" id="BE-0414">A Five Year Comparison at a<br>
Usage Rate of 50,000 pages per year</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0415">This graph compares the total costs of one color KIC BookEdge
system with a color copier and a black and white copier. Both
copiers are the kinds typically seen in academic libraries.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0416">The costs are broken into two main areas: equipment and
maintenance, and consumables. With KIC BookEdge, electronic
output is assumed to be preferred over print 90% of the
time. That ratio has ranged from 75-95% electronic in 2012, but
is certain to rise in the future.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0417">So why is speed so important?</p>

<ul class="peppermint" id="BE-0418">
 <li>It's economical. One KIC Bookeye can replace multiple copiers
or other face-down scanning machines.</li>
 <li>It gives patrons another reason to visit your library.</li>
 <li>It's green. The faster it is, the more use it will get and the less
the copier will be used.</li> 
</ul> 

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0419">In the digital world, there is no paper,
toner or ink, so libraries rarely charge for
images, whether black and white or color.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0420">Over the years, many libraries experimented with color copiers,
but could never find a formula that worked. If the fees were low,
patrons would copy materials with so much color that the library
would spend more on ink than the fees they were collecting. If the
fees were too high, the usage would be so low that the cost of the
machine couldn't be justified.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0421">KIC calculates the amount of color in an image before it is printed.
So the fee for copies with a little bit of color can be the same as
the fee for black and white copies. If a copy has a lot of color, the
fee can be increased in proportion to the cost of the color ink or
toner. This wonderful feature should be a simple, easy byproduct
of the digital age, and it is with KIC.</p>

<p class="block_text3" id="BE-0422">At a usage rate of 50,000 pages per year, these<br>
numbers represent a five-year savings of $36,358!</p>
