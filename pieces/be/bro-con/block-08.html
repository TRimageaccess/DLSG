<h2 id="BE-0803">Enhance Reports</h2>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0804">KIC BookEdge's 11.8x17"<br>
bed can be used to capture<br>
one page at a time using the<br>
spine-preserving "book edge"<br>
feature, or two pages at a time<br>
by opening the book 180<br>
degrees.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0805">Use whole pages or clip<br>
selected pictures, graphs,<br>
text, etc. using KIC's large<br>
touch screen.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0806">Save scanned images to USB<br>
flash drive or cloud storage,<br>
send them via email address<br>
or transfer images directly to a<br>
tablet, notebook PC, or smart<br>
phone.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0807">Enhance reports in a word<br>
processing program. Drag de-<br>
sired images from a flash drive,<br>
Cloud storage or email directly<br>
into a word processing pro-<br>
gram, or save images to your<br>
computer desktop and use the<br>
'insert picture' function.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0808">Once images are imported<br>
into a word processing pro-<br>
gram, you may want to resize<br>
or reposition them or select<br>
from several ways that your<br>
text can wrap around the<br>
pictures.</p>

<h2 id="BE-0809">For Study</h2>
<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0810">Quickly scan many pages<br>
to take with you and study<br>
at your convenience in<br>
the comfort of your home<br>
where you can read, search,<br>
markup, and print at your<br>
leisure.</p>

<h2 id="BE-0811">Book Excerpts</h2>
<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0812">With KIC in your library,<br>
instructors are no longer<br>
restricted to a single text<br>
book. They can freely<br>
assign many excerpts<br>
from many books without<br>
adding to the students'<br>
already high cost of text<br>
books.</p>

<p id="BE-0813">Course Materials</p>
<p id="BE-0814">Class Notes</p>
<p id="BE-0815">Class Handouts</p>

<h2 id="BE-0816">Personal & Family Documents</h2>
<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0817">Library patrons bring loose<br>
paper from home to scan,<br>
fax and send via email or<br>
save to a USB device. A<br>
$5 USB thumb drive can<br>
store thousands of important<br>
documents.</p>

<h2 id="BE-0818">Scan Journals for Research</h2>
<h2 id="BE-0819">Scan Artwork</h2>
<h2 id="BE-0820">Scan Large<br> Maps & Drawings</h2>

<p class="block_text2" id="BE-0821">Many citizens don't have a safe, reliable place to store and
organize their important documents. Documents scanned at
the local library can be viewed with any low cost smart phone.</p>

<p class="block_text3" id="BE-0822">"I selected excerpts from eight books
and created the text book I use for my
Civil War class."</p>
