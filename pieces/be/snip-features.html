The KIC BookEdge was specifically designed to occupy the same space as a typical floor-standing photocopier. 
Replacing outmoded copiers in academic and research libraries is easy with KIC BookEdge's modern scanning, printing and interactive computerized touch screen technology. 
With the addition of a color laser printer, the KIC BookEdge provides the functionality of a color copier at a fraction of the cost.
