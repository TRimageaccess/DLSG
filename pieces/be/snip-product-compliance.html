 <p>
 The FCC Declaration of Conformity or the FCC mark is a certification mark employed on electronic products manufactured or sold in the United States which certifies that the electromagnetic interference from the device is under limits approved by the Federal Communications Commission. 
 The FCC label is found even on products sold outside the US territory, because they are either products manufactured in the US and had been exported, or they were manufactured in other nations which have US as a prime market (eg: Japan, China). 
 This makes the FCC label recognizable worldwide even to people to whom the name of the agency Federal Communications Commission is not familiar.
