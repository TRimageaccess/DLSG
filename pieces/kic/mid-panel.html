 <h2><a href="kic-stats.html">KIC Usage Statistics</a></h2>
 <p>Knowledge Imaging Center kiosks are designed from the ground up for university libraries.
 The centerpiece of the kiosk, a color book scanner, is made to handle virtually any size books as well as flat material from postage stamp size up to 17 x 24 inches in black and white or full color.</p>
 <p>KIC allows students to capture study material to their notebook computers, where they're spending an ever increasing amount of time.
 KIC also makes it easy to enhance the quality of reports and papers with crystal clear color and black and white excerpts from books, magazines and journals.</p>
 <p>As a UDSA compliant digitization system, conveniently located amongst the stacks, KIC can be used as an ad hoc digitization station by your Preservation, Archive and Interlibrary Loan departments.</p>
 <p>KIC kiosks output to paper and USB Flash Drives (e.g. Jump Drives), and can transfer across the Internet directly to the student's PC.</p>  
 
 <h2>KIC APPLICATIONS</h2>
 <p><span class="feature-label">Reports and Papers</span></p>
 <p>Today, most students use computers to create their reports and papers.
 Without an easy way to digitize excerpts from books and magazines, they must print their papers with space reserved for excerpted text, photos, graphs and charts, copy the excerpts, clip and paste or tape, then finally copy the resulting document.</p>
 <p>Some university libraries have small, 'personal' flatbed scanners attached to a few of their computers.
 However, as long as the capture of text, photos, charts and graphs from your collection is cumbersome and inconvenient, digitization will not be considered an everyday tool that enhances the value of library resources.
 KIC is the most cost-effective way to provide students and faculty with high quality, high speed scanning of excerpts from books and large materials.
 Virtually any digitization need is handled easily by KIC kiosks.</p>

 <p><span class="feature-label">Collecting library research digitally and studying on-screen</span></p>
 <p>People spend more time in their favorite environments. Such is the case with the notebook computer.
 By making it very easy to digitize selected research, KIC provides libraries with another direct connection to the students' notebook computers.
 PDF files, the preferred output format for studying, provides students with the ability to electronically highlight, underline or strikethrough selected text.</p>

 <p><span class="feature-label">KIC has many ways to store, send and print information</span></p>
 <ul>
  <li>USB drive</li>
  <li>E-mail, FTP</li>
  <li>PDF and searchable PDF</li>
  <li>Audio Podcast</li>
  <li>Local or Network Printer</li>
 </ul>
<p>KIC even integrates with coin and copy card cost recovery systems. 
(e.g. Backboard, Pharos, OneCard, Debitech)</p>
