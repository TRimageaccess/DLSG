<h1 class="block-title" id="BE-0111">Slash paper and ink costs with the innovative<br>
KIC BookEdge self-serve scan and copy system!</h1>

<p class="block_text2" id="BE-0112">The days of the photo copier on the library floor are over. Students
demand digital, and your print collections are too valuable not to
make them available to the majority of college students today who
see copiers as "old school."</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="BE-0113">Occupying less space than a floor standing copier and offering
12x17 inch book-edge scanning, KIC BookEdge provides the next
best thing to face-up scanning in a form factor that's small enough
to fit in the far corners of any library! And its cost is small too.</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="BE-0114">But don't let its size fool you. KIC BookEdge systems provide the
same extensive capabilities as our heavy duty KIC systems: fast
scan/copy/fax/print, image editing and collating, save to tablets,
smart phones, notebook PCs, USB drives, and Cloud, send via
email or FTP.</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="BE-0115">What's so special about KIC systems is how easy they are to
use with their True2Touch interface and very large touch screens.
Students enjoy unlimited, fast and easy access to entire library
collections, <span class="bold">digitally</span>. It's not often that a service becomes so
popular with students so rapidly. It's fitting that KIC systems are
frequently purchased using student technology funds.</p>
