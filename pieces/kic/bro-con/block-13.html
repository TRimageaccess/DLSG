To fully earn the 'hybrid library' designation, a library's print collections must be available in digital format. 
KIC systems allow your students and faculty to select material for quick and easy self-serve digitization, providing a valuable conduit between your print collections and patron PCs.

KIC's self-serve digitize-on-demand capabilities leverage your library's most valuable assets. 
Digital images don't have the limitations of physical copies. 
They can instantly be shared with fellow researchers around the world via email, dramatically facilitating collaboration.
