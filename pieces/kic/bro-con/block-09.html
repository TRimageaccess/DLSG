The face-up scanning capability of KIC Bookeye 4 and KIC Click&trade; systems enables users to capture multiple pages far more easily than ever before -
books no longer need to be flipped over to turn the page and then flipped back over for each scan or copy. 
KIC systems scan up to ten times faster than a typical flatbed scanner and over twice as fast as a high speed copier. 
In addition, it produces either color or black &amp; white images for the same cost, which equates to substantial savings. 
Finally, KIC promotes a cleaner environment by reducing paper and toner use.
