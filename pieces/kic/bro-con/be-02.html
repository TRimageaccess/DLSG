Is your library floor space in short supply? 
Are there any low traffic areas in your library? 
Do you have special or satellite libraries?
The small footprint of the KIC BookEdge is designed specifically for self-service walk-up scanning as a copier replacement solution in limited spaces and locations where heavier duty cycle KIC systems aren't practical.
</p>
<p>
Occupying less space than a floor standing copier and offering 12x17 inch book-edge scanning, KIC BookEdge provides the next best thing to face-up scanning in a form factor that's small enough to fit in the far corners of any library! 
And its cost is small too.

But don't let its size fool you. 
KIC BookEdge systems provide the same extensive capabilities as our heavier duty cycle KIC systems:
fast scanning, image editing, 'SAVE' to a USB device, 'SEND' an email, FTP, copy, collate and print to a laser printer.
</p>
<p>
What's so special about KIC systems is that they enable students to enjoy unlimited fast and easy access to entire library collections, <span class="emphasis">digitally</span>. 
It's not often that a service becomes so popular with students so rapidly. 
It's fitting that KIC systems are frequently purchased using student technology funds.
