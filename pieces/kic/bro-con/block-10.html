KIC's revolutionary True 2-Touch user interface is so intuitive that even the most inexperienced users can immediately scan materials and save them on a USB thumb drive in minutes.
</p>
<p>
Ease-of-use is an essential feature of KIC.
The "Scan" and "Save, Send or Print" buttons occupy a very large portion of the 17" touch screen.
The "Save" button defaults to an output method that is selectable by the institution.
If a flash drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it will save to the flash drive.
Users can override the default output method by manually selecting one or more other methods of output.
