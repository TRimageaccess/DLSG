<h3 class="mint">No More Book Spine Damage</h3>
<p>
Face-up KIC systems scan book pages "two-up", analyze the single image, and automatically split the image into two separate images - all in one step that takes just 5 seconds.
The KIC BookEdge captures one page at-a-time without damage to book spines.  
Minimizing book spine damage is especially important because, unlike digital content that can be loaned a limited number of times, excerpts of printed books can be scanned an unlimited number of times.  
This is why self-serve scanning systems dramatically increases the value of your existing print collections.

In addition to splitting two-up images into individual pages and rotating page images to their proper orientation, the black edges are automatically removed and the content straightened, producing clean, professional looking images.  
This is especially important for electronic reserves, course curriculum materials and research reports.
These automatic image treatment functions also save time for faculty and administrators.
