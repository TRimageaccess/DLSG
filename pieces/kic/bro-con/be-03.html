<p>
The KIC BookEdge is the perfect choice for student walk-up scanning and copying in areas where space is a premium. 
It makes entire library collections available in digital form. 
The KIC BookEdge's clever design allows users to scan pages right up to the bound margin near the spine, without damaging books. 
The KIC BookEdge produces beautiful, full-color images at no additional cost over black &amp; white images! 
Even searchable PDF's and text-to-speech (MP3 files) are a snap to create.

<p>
The KIC BookEdge was specifically designed to occupy the same space as a typical floor-standing photocopier. 
Replacing outmoded copiers in academic and research libraries is easy with KIC BookEdge's modern scanning, printing and interactive computerized touch screen technology. 
With the addition of a color laser printer, the KIC BookEdge provides the functionality of a color copier at a fraction of the cost.
