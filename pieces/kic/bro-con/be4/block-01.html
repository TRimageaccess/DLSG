<h1 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0108">Study, Report, Research, Collaborate ... Digitally</h1>

<p class="block_text" id="BE4-0109">KIC Bookeye 4 is an indispensable tool for research, study and
production of enhanced quality reports and papers with crystal
clear color and black & white excerpts from books, magazines and
very large journals. In addition, as a UDSA compliant digitize-on-demand
system conveniently located among the stacks, KIC can
be used as an ad hoc digitization station by Interlibrary Loan departments.</p>

<p class="block_text" id="BE4-0110">With its 600 dpi option, KIC Bookeye 4
sytems are perfect as shared resources,
capturing the finest details for digital
archival and preservation.</p>

<p class="block_text" id="BE4-0111">The KIC Bookeye 4 can capture 20 book pages per minute for
instant access on tablets, notebooks, smart devices and easy
transfer to desktop PCs and servers. With a bed size more than
40% larger than its nearest competitor, Bookeye 4 is also the only
high resolution scanner in the world that supports both v-cradle and
flat modes, and can scan material as large as 24 x 17 inches.</p>

<p class="block_text" id="BE4-0112">Photocopiers, fax machines, PCs, monitors and keyboards clutter
up otherwise beautiful libraries across America. KIC Bookeye.4
reverses that trend, replacing copiers and fax machines and
adding scanning in a single machine with clean lines and efficient
design.</p>
