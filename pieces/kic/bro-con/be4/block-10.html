<h1 class="block-title2" id="BE4-1001">The Hybrid Library</h1>

<p class="block_text25" id="BE4-1002">To fully earn the 'hybrid library' designation, a library's
existing print collections must be available in digital
format. KIC systems allow your students and faculty
to select material for quick and easy self-serve digiti- zation,
providing a valuable conduit between your print
collections and patron tablets, PCs, eReaders and
smart devices.</p>

<p class="block_text25" id="BE4-1003">KIC's self-serve digitize-on-demand capabilities leverage
your library's most valuable assets - its print collections.</p>

<p class="block_text25" id="BE4-1004">Digital images don't have the limitations of physical copies.
They can instantly be shared with fellow researchers around the
world via email or Cloud, dramatically facilitating collaboration.</p>

<p class="block_text25" id="BE4-1005">KIC avoids the digital rights management conundrum. Each
digitization is for a single use, but thousands of patrons can digi- tize
content from the same book, yet preserve the book's spine.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-1006">Resource Sharing</h2>

<p class="block_text26" id="BE4-1007">We know the importance of resource sharing. To help squeeze
more value out of your investment, KIC can be configured to
support the BSCAN Interlibrary Loan system, the Opus Digitiza- tion
Workflow system, and general ad hoc scanning.</p>

<p class="block_text26" id="BE4-1008">Use a USB flash drive to enable other types of scanning at a
KIC station and temporarily access shared folders on a network.
When you unplug the USB, the KIC station automatically returns
to its regular self-serve scanning station functionality.</p>

<p class="block_text26" id="BE4-1009">For general purpose scanning by ad- ministrators
and faculty, simply write
a department password file to a flash
drive. When a user plugs in the USB
'key', KIC recognizes the password and
allows the user to save scanned images to shared folders.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-1010">Premium Maintenance Plan</h2>

<p class="block_text26" id="BE4-1011">Image Access has an unmatched service and support record. It
is impossible to affordably provide service personnel living in every
city and town across America that are highly trained on the
very special technologies needed by libraries. Instead, DLSG
designs remote serviceability into its products and has perfected
remote diagnosis and when possible, repair.</p>

<p class="block_text26" id="BE4-1012">The resulting savings allows DLSG to frequently and promptly
provide loaner/swap-out equipment and to go on site whenever
necessary to maintain and repair equipment, minimizing interruptions
in service for your patrons.</p>
