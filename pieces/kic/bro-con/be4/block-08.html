<h1 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0801">KIC Bookeye vs. Copiers - How KIC Compares</h1>
<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0802">Copiers are Outmoded</h2>

<p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0803">Since the first KIC was delivered to an academic library in 2004, the
days of photocopiers for patron use in academic libraries and even
public libraries were numbered. And now with the rapid explosion of
tablet computers and electronic readers, the demand in academic
libraries for electronic copies has substantially outstripped the de- mand
for printed copies. The demand for electronic copies in public
libraries is also reaching a tipping point.</p>

<p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0804">The ability to capture virtually unlimited numbers of pages of re- search
into a tablet or electronic reader and search through that ma- terial
on the Internet with a tablet, eReader or notebook PC that can
be used just about anywhere is highly convenient and immensely
valuable. In this digital age, academic libraries are compelled to go
hybrid for three reasons: 1) the high demand for digital content; 2)
their existing print collections contain vast amounts of information
that cannot be found on the Internet; and 3) students are receptive
to the price of electronic copies - typically free.</p>

<p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0805">So how do the costs of KIC systems compare with those of photo
copiers? There are three main factors that keep the cost of photo- 
copies high: 1) each copy requires paper, toner and ink; 2) photo-</p>

<p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0806">copiers require a lot of maintenance due
to the number of moving parts; and 3) all
major photocopier brands use a distributed
service model.</p>

<p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0807">In contrast, these costs are lower for KIC
because KIC has split the scan/copy
functions into three separate machines,
choosing the best of breed for each. As a
result, KIC offers the best book scanners
by themselves or with a loose-leaf paper
(ADF) scanner. Virtually any off-the-shelf
laser or inkjet printer can be added to any
KIC system, so you can optimize costs
and speeds, and offer affordable color.</p>

<p id="BE4-0808">ADF attachment scans<br>
40 loose-leaf pages/min<br>
(20 sheets per minute)</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0809">KIC Bookeye 4 Scanners vs. Copiers</h2>

<p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0810">This graph compares the total costs of one color KIC Bookeye
4 system with three color copiers and with three black and white
copiers. Both copiers are the kinds typically seen in academic
libraries. One KIC Bookeye 4 is compared with three copiers
because its face-up operation yields well over two times the perfor-</p>

<p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0811">mance of a typical copier. The costs
are broken into three main areas: equipment
and maintenance, consumables, and
patron usage time. With KIC, electronic
output is assumed to be preferred over
print 90% of the time. That ratio has ranged
from 75-95% electronic in 2012, but is certain
to rise in the future.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0812">No More Book Spine Damage!</h2>

<p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0813">Thick books with stiff spines and content that runs deep into
the bookfold are often damaged when copied. KIC Bookeye
4 easily captures content without damaging book spines.</p>

<p class="block_text20" id="BE4-0814">KIC automatically removes black<br>
edges, straightens content,<br>
and produces clean, pro-<br>
fessional looking images<br>
- important for elec-<br>
tronic reserves, course<br>
curriculum materials<br>
and research reports.<br>
These automatic image<br>
treatment functions also<br>
save a lot of administrator,<br>
faculty, and student time.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0815">Thick Books...No Problem</h2>

<p class="block_text21" id="BE4-0816">KIC Bookeye 4 handles thick books beautifully. Its contour-<br>finding
laser allows it to flatten even the most curved books<br>
and produce text that is clear and undistorted. KIC automati-<br>cally
adds margins for print-ready image quality.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0817">KIC Bookeye Scans 3 Times Faster</h2>

<p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0818">Statistics from five million scanning sessions across America revealed
a median session length of 23 pages. So, most of the time
spent during a KIC session is spent scanning. Face up scanning
has been proven to be three times faster than face down scanning.</p>

<p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0819">So why is speed so important?</p>

<ul class="peppermint" id="BE4-0820">
 <li>It's economical. One KIC Bookeye can replace multiple copiers
or other face-down scanning machines.</li>
 <li>It gives patrons another reason to visit your library.</li>
 <li>It's green. The faster it is, the more use it will get and the less
the copier will be used.</li> 
</ul> 

<p class="block_text22" id="BE4-0821">In the digital world, there is no paper,
toner or ink, so libraries rarely charge for
images, whether black and white or color.</p>

<p class="block_text22" id="BE4-0822">Over the years, many libraries experimented with color copiers,
but could never find a formula that worked. If the fees were low,
patrons would copy materials with so much color that the library
would spend more on ink than the fees they were collecting. If the
fees were too high, the usage would be so low that the cost of the
machine couldn't be justified.</p>

<p class="block_text22" id="BE4-0823">KIC calculates the amount of color in an image before it is printed.
So the fee for copies with a little bit of color can be the same as
the fee for black and white copies. If a copy has a lot of color, the
fee can be increased in proportion to the cost of the color ink or
toner. This wonderful feature should be a simple, easy byproduct
of the digital age, and it is with KIC.</p>
