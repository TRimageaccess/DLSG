KIC is an indispensable study and research tool that enhances reports and papers with crystal clear color and black &amp; white pictures, graphs, and excerpts from books, magazines and journals. 
In addition, as a UDSA compliant digitize-on-demand system conveniently located among the stacks, KIC can be used as an ad hoc digitization station by Preservation, Archive and Interlibrary Loan departments.
