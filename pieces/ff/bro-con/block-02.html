The Opus digitization process was designed specifically for academic libraries, museums and archives. 
Use Opus FreeFlow to build digital assets for preservation, archive, digital collections for the Web, and for viewing software. 
Its image treatment processes such as fan, gutter and book curvature removal, and content location and registration, are dramatically faster and easier to use than photo editing software.

<p>
Opus FreeFlow operates a wide array of preservation quality scanners and allows for the import of existing images as well. 
It then groups images into objects (i.e. books), which are easily managed and processed. 
Finally, it renders those objects into a variety of derivatives.

With Opus FreeFlow 3-tab interface, users can switch dynamically between scanning, image treatment and outputting derivatives. 
Multipage objects can be reopened and reprocessed at any time. 
Pages can be deleted and rescanned and new pages can be scanned and inserted.
Unlimited derivatives can be created with variations in image size, resolution, format and file type.
</p>
<p>
Opus FreeFlow is fully compatible with Opus Digitization Workflow software. 
While objects are in the middle of the Opus workflow, they can be opened with Opus FreeFlow for additional scanning, image modification and derivative generation.
