Opus FreeFlow digitization software provides all the necessary functionality to create digital books and other materials from scanned images. 
Prior to Opus, digitization had to be performed one image at a time using photo editors for image treatment, and content managers for keying metadata. 
With Opus Freeflow, after scanning and treating images, digital derivative images are output to destinations such as digital content management systems and digital master images to digital archive systems.
</p>
<p>
Opus Workflow software allows for the use of temporary workers with minimal training while minimizing the chance of errors and ensuring that preservation quality standards are met. 
Unlike FreeFlow, Opus Workflow applies somewhat rigid management principles. Opus FreeFlow and Opus Digitization 
Workflow work seamlessly together to allow a trained digitization staff member to perform processing at any time and output independently of the structured workflow.
</p>
<p>
In addition, Opus FreeFlow works with third-party software. 
For example, if a user wishes to perform an image treatment function supported by a popular photo editor, the press of a button in Opus FreeFlow can launch the third-party application with the current image ready for editing. 
Once the edits are completed and saved, exiting the photo editor will return the user to Opus FreeFlow with the image showing the modifications that were made.
