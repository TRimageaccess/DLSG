  <p>Since 1988, The Répertoire international de la presse musicale RIPM has produced - with the collaboration of scholars
     and institutions in twenty countries - 205 volumes and a database of 500,000 + annotated records indexing the content
     of music journals published between 1800 and 1950. While RIPM's indexes are available online through EBSCO, NISC, OCLC and OVID,
     one obvious problem remains... making these periodicals available on the internet</P>
   <p>In preparation for this major digitization initiative RIPM consulted specialists, tested equipment and evaluated software...
      and then selected DLSG to fulfill its complex software and workflow requirements. </p>
   <p>RIPM has already digitized 500,000 + images using OPUS, and our engineers have developed a new automated system
      to highlight the portions of a page(s) corresponding to specific records. DLSG has also created RIPM's user-friendly
      interface that allows easy manipulation of page images and simultaneous viewing of both bibliographical records and the
      pages to which they refer. </P>
   <p>DLSG is pleased to collaborate with RIPM on this important undertaking and to fulfill in this manner the needs
      of the preservation and access community. For more information see <a href="www.ripm.org">www.ripm.org</a></P>
