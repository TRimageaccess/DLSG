  <p>New Hampshire chooses Image Access and the DLSG to meet its university library digitization needs, purchasing a Knowledge Imaging
     Center (KIC II) for four universities and a Bookeye 3 for three universities. Beginning this fall, students and faculty will be able
     to scan books and other objects up to 17x24 inches in full color in five to fifteen seconds per scan.
     The three Bookeye 3s were purchased with glass plates and foot pedals and will be used to meet various digitization needs.</p>
