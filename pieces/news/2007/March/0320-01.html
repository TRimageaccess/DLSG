  <p>Barbara Rivers, head of reprographics at UCLA has 140 copiers for their entire campus under her purview.
     After seeing the Knowledge Imaging Center (KIC) at an ALA exhibition, she said, "I was sure that a significant portion of
     our students would prefer scanning in color to copying in black & white and also prefer to leave the book face-up while scanning
     multiple pages. When I first saw KIC, I knew immediately that this was exactly what we needed! It'll even handle documents
     that are twice as big as a copier can handle. I think that every library needs at least one KIC system."</p>
