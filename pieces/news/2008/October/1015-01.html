 <div class="news-story">
  <p>In October of 2008, the Santa Fe Trail Center began to digitize the history of people who traveled and lived along
     the Santa Fe Trail using its newly acquired Bookeye 3 and Opus Digitization Workflow Software.</p>
   <p>Nearby, Fort Larned was home to the 10th Calvary, known as the Buffalo Soldiers.
      These troops protected mail coaches, freighters and other traffic on the Trail and were the buffer between the white
      man and the Native Americans. See their faces and images at <a href="http://www.santafetrailcenter.org">http://www.santafetrailcenter.org</a>.</P>
