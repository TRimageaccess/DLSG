  <p>The history of converting wind energy into mechanical energy through simple but effective technology is being recorded
     by more modern technology – the Bookeye scanner.</p>
  <p>For the Wind Power Museum, housing one of the largest wind turbine collections in the country wasn’t enough
     to tell the story of using wind to power our livelihoods and our lives. Bookeye technology converted all of the
     literature about these wonderful machines, making it available to the Internet community on the museum’s Website.</p>
   <p>It is notable that Bookeyes are Energy Star efficient and use such little energy that even a small windmill can power them.</P>
