  <p>When SUNY Buffalo saw BSCAN ILL at a DLSG seminar, they had many questions. Their ILL volumes were increasing and they had
     recently acquired ILLiad to bring order to their operations and they came to the seminar looking for better scanners.
     They concluded that the Bookeye 2 and WideTEK Super B would give them the performance they needed.
     But upon hearing about BSCAN ILL software, their interest level peaked. Every feature presented would later become a requirement.
     In fact, one feature that was mentioned wasn’t yet released when they purchased several BSCAN ILL systems soon after the seminar.
     That feature was the automatic notification of ILLiad when Ariel requests were automatically fulfilled by BSCAN ILL and they immediately
     noticed its absence. Needless to say, the DLSG immediately applied the necessary resources to get them that feature.
     Today, they are quite satisfied with the way BSCAN ILL consolidates a lot of functions and processes into a simple, efficient interface.</p>
