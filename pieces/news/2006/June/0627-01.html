  <p>Was it really that a part of the Bookeye 3 shipment was lost in the Cascades by a local trucking company, or was it a convenient
     story so the DLSG field engineer (and avid fisherman) could make a second trip to Montana in June? Unversity of Montana's Bookeye 3
     A1 was flown straight from the Image Access factory in Europe to Seattle and trucked to Montana. Somehow, a box was separated from
     the main crate and lost with no trace. Then a week later, it resurfaced and was finally delivered. Just another fish story? </p>
