  <p>Harvard University learns first-hand how much better our diagnostics over the web and overnight swap-out maintenance program can be.
     Prior to the release of KIC II, Harvard had committed to purchasing 10 walk-up scanning systems for multifunction copiers.
     When a failure occurred, the photocopier maintenance organization that was responsible for the units sent out a software technician when
     it was not a software problem and a hardware technician when it was not a hardware problem. On more than one occasion, many frustrating
     days passed before problems were resolved. When a KIC failure occurred, a DLSG technician logged in over the Web, determined that the failure
     could not be resolved remotely and sent a swap-out scanner for next day delivery. In a single day, they were up and running again.
     A university staff member indicated in an email that the difference in quality of service was stark.</p>
