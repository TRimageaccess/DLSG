  <p>Looking at 2006 usage statistics, Debora Morley, the Director of Information Technology Services in the Harvard College
     Library reported to us recently that while KIC represents 10&#37; of their publicly accessible walk-up scanning systems, it is being used
     25&#37; of the time. This high usage difference probably couldn't happen unless many of the KIC users were walking past
     one or more of the other walk-up scanning systems. This also begs the question how much more scanning would be done if the
     library were full of KIC systems?</p>
