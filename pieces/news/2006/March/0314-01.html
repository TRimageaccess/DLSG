  <p>The KIC I was voted for by the students to be purchased from their fund. It's a beautiful combination of hardwood and technology.
     However, the unit was a bit pricey. When KIC II came out at essentially half the price, we knew that it was only a matter of time
     before we got one. KIC II is actually attractive in a functional technology way. And it' s footprint is smaller.
     We' re excited to see how students react to the new unit.</p>
