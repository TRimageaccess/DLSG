  <p>When the USB connector on their KIC system failed, Rhode Island School of Design's (RISD) library administrators reported
     that they were inundated with student complaints. The DLSG quickly resolved the issue. One RISD official later commented:
     "It was a mixed blessing. The popularity of KIC was clearly validated, but we don't want a simple connector failure to impact KIC usage.
     The DLSG responded by shipping us two spare connectors and informing us that they are enhancing their KIC maintenance policy
     to include keeping at least one spare USB connector inside the secure KIC cabinet of all future KIC systems shipped."</p>
