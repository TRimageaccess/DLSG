  <p>In a cooperative digitization effort with with Biblioteca Palafoxiana, Texas A&M University transported their Bookeye
     scanner to the historic library to digitize some of its rare and unique volumes. Dedicated in 1646, it reflects its European
     inheritance and contains more than 41 thousand books and unique manuscripts from 1473 to 1821, including 70 incunabula.
     The library is the oldest public library in the Americas, and its contents are considered a world UNESCO sight. </p>
