 <div class="news-story">
  <p>The DLSG collected one month worth of usage reports from 24 KIC systems in the field and total scans for the month
     came to 338,000. That’s an average of 14,000 scans per KIC system. For the majority of the KIC systems in the report,
     color scans of any size are free for students and faculty.</p>
  <p>The general consensus seems to be that since there are no expendables and the KIC systems can produce millions
     of images for no additional cost, it is better not to ‘nickel and dime’ the students (literally), in the case of KIC.
     However, about 10% of libraries still charge patrons to use KIC. </p>
