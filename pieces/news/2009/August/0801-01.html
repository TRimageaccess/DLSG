  <p>At their annual meeting in Austin, Texas (August 11-16, 2009), the Society of American Archivists were treated
     to demonstrations of a tandem configuration of Bookeye 3 scanners.</p>
   <p>These linear CCD scanners produce so much high resolution data that they take a few seconds to transfer a scanned
      image to its computer over a Gigabit Ethernet cable. During this idle time, the worker is able to turn to a second scanner,
      lift the glass plate, turn the page and start another scan, then turn back to the first scanner.
      The resulting rhythm is fairly easy to maintain. The throughput achieved is comparable to automatic page turning scanners,
      yet the images are of a quality that can only be achieved with linear CCD technology.</p>
