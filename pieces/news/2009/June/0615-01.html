  <p>Design school students find KIC perfect for creating animation shorts. Give them the tools and you can expect university students
     to find a way to use them in a manner that was not anticipated. In this animation short, more than 1,000 images were captured
     sequentially on the Bookeye to make a fascinating and well thought out movie.</p>
  <p>Quoting the author, "All the pictures, I took in the library with 'Bookeye' which is an amazing scanner."
