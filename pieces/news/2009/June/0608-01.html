  <p>Lines of students waiting to use KIC systems are not uncommon. Some institutions are even trying to discourage overuse
     by some students. At one institution, administrators put up a sign saying 'DON'T HOG THE KIC.' </p>
  <p>This institution reports that while the units are often busy, lines regularly form in the beginning
     of each term, when course study materials are scanned and as finals approach, when final exam study materials are scanned. </P>
