  <p>At the University of Kansas, having had prior experience with KIC systems located in their Arts &amp;
     Architecture, Rare Books, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences and Sciences libraries, an Associate Librarian told us they "had
     to purchase two KIC systems and put them side-by-side in their main library because the students are so elated with KIC
     that we have to purchase two to keep the lines down."</p>
