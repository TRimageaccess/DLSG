  <p>In response to requests for a faster scanner for ILL departments, the WideTEK Super B motor and firmware
     has been updated so that it can now scan two book pages in two seconds. Originally built to provide a low cost
     solution for digital preservation, this WideTEK produces very high quality images faster than any other scanner in its class.
     It wasn’t very long after its introduction that it caught the eye of ILL departments. And since digital ILL requires only 200-300
     dots per inch resolution, the scanner speed could be increased when scanning at these lower resolutions. When purchased with BSCAN ILL,
     the system reads request sheets and automatically sends the requests without any keying. BSCAN ILL produces perfect digital documents and
     automatically delivers them via email and FTP, and through Ariel, ILLiad (Odyssey), RAPID, and all other popular delivery systems.
     The WideTEK Super B still scans at preservation resolutions, but the new version is a little faster. For more information, contact Mark Surkis
