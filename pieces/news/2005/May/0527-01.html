  <p>DLSG introduces KIC II, a smaller, lower cost metal version of the Knowledge Imaging Center, a high
     speed self serve digitization system with copy card and coin operation support for students, faculty and administrators.
     By eliminating the CD burning/labeling robot and built-in printer and supporting USB flash memory devices, email and FTP
     for digital output and existing printer queues for hard copy output, KIC II users are on and off the system that much quicker,
     providing greater resource availability. In addition, the lower price allows KIC II units to be distributed throughout the library
     facilities, with a single KIC I unit centrally located in each facility.</p>
     
  <p>To substantially reduce the initial investment, this new unit is offered as a peripheral device with four cables
     to attach the Bookeye scanner, 17” touch screen and USB flash memory port to a customer provided PC.
     The PC is housed in the KIC cabinet with a locking back door. A higher speed PC and large LCD display for viewing
     of digitized image is recommended. The KIC maintenance contract covers the Bookeye, touch screen and software while the PC
     is covered by the institution’s contract with its PC supplier</p> 
     
   <p>While PC labs are an easy place to add digitization capabilities, the only cost-justifiable scanners for PC labs are
      very low speed, which makes them a very underutilized resource. As Karen Lawson of Ohio State University says,
      “Those little consumer scanners in PC labs are like buying a fleet of vans that can’t go over 5 miles an hour.
      While our first KIC unit was purchased by student vote, a demonstration for faculty nearly invoked tears with comments
      like ‘no more photocopying, cutting and taping to make course curriculum materials.’ Quick and easy use, large scan area,
      USB flash drive, email and FTP support make KIC a great addition to our access services. With KIC, we now have a hybrid library.”</p>
