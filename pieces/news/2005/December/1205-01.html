  <p>Hello Mark &#91;Surkis&#91;, </P>
  <p>I want to thank you and your associates for a very interesting and informative seminar.
     The history of the company and the principles held by the present management team made a positive impact on my views about doing business with you.
     I was impressed with the innovative thinking expressed and the commitment to customer service that came through from teams presentations.
     I was also pleased and excited to hear that you were working with the Atlas Company to have your products compatible with ILLiad and Odyssey
     as we are a very new ILLiad user member. I would have liked to see and hear more about the ILL B-Scan and mobile unit, but I understand that your
     agenda was affected by the weather and other uncontrollable circumstances. I have been interested in the ILL B-Scan program and the mobile unit
     since earlier this year. However, now that we have purchased ILLiad, all our time and energy will be focused on implementation and other areas
     will have to be delayed until the summer semesters. Thank you again for inviting me and for the lovely luncheon.
     I hope to talk with you more later this year.</p>
  <p>Regards, Pat Pat Barbour, Interlibrary Loan Coordinator Central Michigan University Libraries
