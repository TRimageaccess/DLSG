  <p>"The California State University (CSU) interlibrary services professionals are continuously looking for new software and
      technologies which will help to improve services and streamline processes within the system. BSCAN ILL has been identified
      as a software which brings electronic delivery of articles to a whole new level. The San Marcos campus which has been using
      the software since July 2005 has found that it allows them to scan and send articles more quickly and to provide their customers
      with better quality images. This product is also available on the campuses of Fullerton and Long Beach where it will soon be implemented.
      As a group, we are interested in seeing how the B-SCAN ILL product can benefit the entire CSU system with electronic delivery of articles."
