   <p>The Digital Library Systems Group will be showing KIC II with Bookeye, OPUS and BSCAN ILL with WideTEK Super B
      flatbed scanners, and our new Bookeye 3. You’ll see how easy it is to produce digital collections with OPUS, how far
      digitization technology has come for ILL and how quickly users can walk up to a KIC system with a book or periodical and
      walk away with images. The DLSG also welcomes you to bring samples of documents with the images scanned using your current scanner(s).
      We will show you the best quality images achievable at whatever scanning speed you choose. You will also be able to compare the quality
      of printed images using a common HP printer. </p>
