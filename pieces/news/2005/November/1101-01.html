  <p>Image Access and DLSG introduce the new Bookeye 3 for digital preservation and access,
     an affordable high-end scanner. The Bookeye 3 is a large color book scanner with a 24x36 inch flatbed,
     a built-in motorized cradle, a true 400 dpi high resolution, cool white LED illumination from both sides and
     superior bookfold correction. With the image quality produced by this scanner, it is possible to read print that is too small
     for most humans and even to create bi-tonal derivatives with clear fine print, even smaller than 4 point text. </p>
  <p>The motorized book cradle can be outfitted with special attachments that prevent delicate books from being opened more than 120&deg;
     while scanning both sides simultaneously. And if you have some high volume production needs, this low cost scanner can very nearly keep
     up with automatic page turners costing six figures while providing much better image quality. </p>
  <p>As with all other specialty scanners from Image Access, the Bookeye 3 is fully equipped with Scan2Net&reg;
     technology with a simple 1 gigahertz Ethernet connection and IP/HTTP protocol. Service diagnostics can be performed remotely
     by factory authorized representatives within minutes of detection of a problem, resulting in immediate resolution when possible. </p>
