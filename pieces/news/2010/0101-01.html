 <div class="news-story">
  <p>On January 1, 2010 Image Access acquired the worldwide sales rights for the Bookeye product family from ImageWare.
     Rüdiger Klepsch, formerly head of sales at ImageWare, has moved to Image Access to head its worldwide channel sales for Bookeye,
     WideTEK and other products, excluding the areas handled by Image Access U.S. headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida.</p>
  <p>By restructuring the sales channels under Image Access, both companies will benefit from the resulting synergies and stronger
     market standing. Image Access has broadened its portfolio and now offers flatbed and wide format scanners up to format A0 under
     the WideTEK brand, as well as planetary scanners from A3 to A1 under the Bookeye brand. ImageWare will retain its primary focus 
     on software and project business in the public and private library markets.</p>
