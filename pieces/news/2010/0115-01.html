  <p>Image Access, Inc. Boca Raton FL announced the release of its highly anticipated Opus Freeflow digitization software.
     Opus Freeflow’s unique three tab interface allows for dynamic movement between capture, image treatment and derivative export,
     providing unparallel workflow flexibility. Designed primarily for ad hoc scanning but fully compatible with Opus Digitization Workflow
     Software, FreeFlow allows users to perform small digitization tasks with minimal effort and optionally bring them into full Opus for
     long-term archival and possible compilation into a course curriculum materials CD or DVD, or for inclusion into future digital collections.</p>
  <p>Opus FreeFlow directly controls the preservation quality Bookeye 3 and WideTEK families of book and large format scanners,
     and all other Scan2Net scanners, Plustek book edge line of scanners, and virtually all other scanner and camera systems through
     its image import facility. The English version is available in North American markets. </p>
