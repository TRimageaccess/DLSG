 <div class="product-tab">  
  <p>   
   Introducing KIC Click Mini, our new and exciting book scanner that achieves a far more affordable price point for face-up book
   scanning than ever before. Are there any compromises? You decide.
  </p>
  <p>
   The KIC Click Mini captures 30 book pages per minute! It produces sharp, clear images in full color at 300dpi for instant
   access on tablets, notebooks, smart devices and easy transfer to desktop PCs and servers. Its 12.25 x 19.2 inch bed size
   is significantly larger than double-letter and is large enough for most book pages. Very large books can be scanned one
   page at a time sideways and the images rotated. And of course, it handles loose paper and other flat material, too.

   Photocopiers, fax machines, PCs, monitors and keyboards clutter up otherwise beautiful libraries across America. KIC
   Click Mini reverses that trend, replacing copiers and fax machines and adding scanning in a single machine with
   clean lines and efficient design.
