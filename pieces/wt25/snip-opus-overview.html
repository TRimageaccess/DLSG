<div class="product-tab"><P>The new WideTEK 25 wide format flatbed scanner is the fully re-engineered successor to the WideTEK A2. Doubling the optical resolution, while offering the higher scanning speed, guarantees an excellent image output. The WideTEK 25 can scan just about anything: from business cards to diagrams in A2 format, books, newspapers, maps, bound documents and more. The scanner needs only three seconds to scan the largest format.</p>
<p>Nearly all functions can be executed directly at the scanner via the integrated touch screen. The Scan2Net&reg; technology from Image Access forms the basis of the innovative user interface: intuitive to use via web browser or touch screen, providing the operator with direct control over practically every scanner function. Using the touch screen display, up to 30 different (password protected) jobs can be defined and stored. This allows operators to create and store templates and choose any predefined location on one of the network drives as a target for the scanned images.</p>
<p>The integrated walk-up scanning software makes the scanner a truly shared device. It allows the user to scan and send images to a specific destination such as a network printer, any directory in the network, or to a USB stick; without having to work with a client PC. Simply walk up, scan and store or send the image, all through the use of the touch screen.</p>
<p>A further innovative feature of the WideTEK 25: All optical components are encapsulated in a hermetically sealed camera box, making it not only dust-free but also very low maintenance. Cleaning the mirrors and the mechanics is no longer required. State of the art illumination using bright white LEDs guarantees long lifetime (50,000 hour lifetime) and excellent scan results at a very low noise level in spite of its high speed.</p>
<p>The WideTEK 25 guarantees results at production scanning speeds for high throughput while delivering images in brilliant colors.</p>
