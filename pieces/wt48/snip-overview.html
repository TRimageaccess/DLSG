<div class="product-tab"><p>The innovative wide format scanner WideTEK 48 for documents up to 48 inches wide (1220 mm) is setting new standards in performance and quality.</P>
<p>This very fast but astonishingly quiet 48 inch color scanner combines user-friendliness, production-ready design and compact dimensions in a new class of scanners.</P>
<p>State of the art illumination using bright white LEDs guarantees long lifetime and best scan results at a very low noise level in spite of the high speed.</P>
<p>The cutting edge camera technology, consisting of a dust-protected, hermetically sealed camera box holding three CCD systems, delivers an optical resolution of 1200 x 600 dpi.</P>
<p>This very compact device is outfitted with a touch screen and integrated walk-up scanning software. The Scan2Net&reg; technology from ImageAccess forms the basis of the innovative user interface: intuitive to use via web browser or touch screen, providing the operator with direct control over practically every scanner function. Using the touch screen display, up to 30 different (password protected) jobs can be defined and stored. This allows operators to create and store templates and choose any predefined location on one of the network drives as a target for the scanned images.</P>
<p>The integrated walk-up scanning software makes the scanner a truly shared device. It allows the user to scan and send images to a specific destination such as a network printer, any directory in the network, or to a USB stick; without having to work with a client PC. Simply walk up, scan and store or send the image, all through the use of the touch screen.</P>
<p>Special transport rollers with individually spring loaded ball bearing pairs serve as pressure points to ensure the best possible, gentle document transport. This allows a maximum document thickness of 3 mm. A new weight balanced back plate allows users to adjust the strength with which the documents are lifted to the scan plane.</P>
<p>Automatic document size recognition allows operators to pass sensitive documents through the middle of the scan area, protecting document edges from any damage. </P>
<p>The exceptionally high scanning speed, dust-protected and encapsulated optical components and the absence of consumables characterize this highly efficient production-ready device. With a life expectancy of over one million scans, the WideTEK 48 redefines the price/performance ratio in the wide format scanner market.</P>
