<p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0704">Ease-of-use is a central feature of KIC. Its large, 22 inch touch screen and its large "Scan" and "Save, Send
or Print" buttons that occupy a very large portion of the touch screen clearly convey how easy KIC is to use.
The Save button defaults to an output method and file format that is selectable by the institution. If a flash
drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it will save to the flash drive.
Users can override the default output method by manually selecting one or more other methods of output.

<p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0705">KIC Bookeye 4's high speed is derived as much from its ultra-simple,
true two-touch interface as from its face-up design that obviates the
need to flip books over and over again during the capture process.</p>

<p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0706">The tabletop model KIC Bookeye 4 has all the True2Touch capabilities of
the full-size KIC. It has its own tabletop version of the SmartDock, and
of course, an ADF scanner can be placed anywhere on the table. ADA
compliance is achieved by purchasing a table with a 30 inch clearance to
the floor and a 31 inch height.</p>

<p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0707">KIC Bookeye 4's elegant design puts the full KIC self-serve
digitization functionality into a compact and appealing space.
Its 17" touch screen and large preview screen and capture
surface are at the perfect height for wheelchair access. The KIC
Bookeye 4 also offers an optional desktop configuration with a
single 22" touch/preview display</p>

<ul class="peppermint2" id="BE4-0712">
 <li>KIC is very agile, and allows the user to jump from just about anywhere
in the touch screen system to just about anywhere else, directly and
usually with a single touch. This modern, 'modeless' design is easier to
use, but difficult to create.</li>
 <li>KIC's large buttons and controls are easy to use, even for people with
unsteady hands.</li>
 <li>KIC gradually expands and contracts controls such as brightness, con- trast
and DPI so users can easliy follow their screen activity.</li>
 <li>KIC doesn't delete original images when you clip a photo or excerpt of
text unless you tell it to.</li> 
 <li>KIC lets you output to many different destinations in a single session.</li>
 <li>Once you've scanned a document, you can change your mind as to
where you would like it to output. For example, you may have wanted
to save to USB, but learned your USB drive is full. Or you may scan
so much that it exceeds your email limit. Or after scanning and collating
a mass of research, you decide that you want to share the research
with others.</li>

<h1 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0713">Two Large Screens for Simplicity & Power</h1>

<p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0714">It's easy to undervalue screen size. For 20 years, all cellphone makers relent- lessly
pursued smaller and smaller screens until very recently when one com- pany
reversed that trend. They realized that people want the largest screen that
will fit in their pocket/purse and hand. This is because display screens are our
window to the digital world, and touch screens give us control over that world.</p>

<p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0715">As big as self-serve scanning systems are, it makes sense to have a very large
touch screen. And with the low prices for high quality displays, it is compelling
to add a separate display screen. In 2002, DLSG realized this, when the first
KIC system was designed. Today, with nearly 10 years more experience than
any other vendor, DLSG has the most understandable, easy to use and powerful
user interface for self-serve book scanning, and it's based on dual screens.</p>

<p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0716">The view screen shows very large, clear images of what you've scanned, allow- ing
the touch screen to have big, easy to understand buttons and other controls.</p>

<p class="block_text17" id="BE4-0717">Display screens are our portals into the digital world, and
touch screens are the easiest way to control that world. That's
why DLSG provides large, 24 inch, full HD displays and
equally large touch screens with most of its KIC systems.</p>
