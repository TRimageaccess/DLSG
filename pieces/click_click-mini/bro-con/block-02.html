<h1 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0201">KIC Serves Over Half of Students at Universities in America</h1>

<p class="block_text" id="CCM-0202">In the U.S. alone, KIC serves over four million students at the top "brick and mortar" (non-online) colleges and universities. With
the introduction of the KIC BookEdge, KIC Click, and KIC Click Mini, KIC is now affordable for virtually all institutions of higher
learning and full-service public libraries. Last decade, libraries typically 'added' several KICs, but since 2010 libraries have begun
to replace their entire patron-use copier fleets with self-serve book scanning systems.</p>

<h1 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0203">A True Digital Age Multifunction System for Academic & Public Libraries</h1>
<h2 id="CCM-0204">Book Scanning</h2>

<p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0205">Students at academic libraries want speed, and DLSG offers the fastest book
scanners on the market. Patrons at public libraries need simplicity, and KIC
provides three of the simplest possible user interfaces, one exclusively for
scanning, one exclusively for copying and one exclusively for faxing. And
KIC's best-of-breed power user interface is only a touch away.</p>

<h2 id="CCM-0206">Copier Replacement</h2>
<p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0207">While multifunction copiers are partly digital,
they are big mechanical machines with big</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0208">
maintenance issues and tiny touch screens. As a copier replacement, KIC eliminates copier
failure/service problems and provides very large touch screens and view screens that are larger
still. Organizing (collating, clipping, rotating, etc.) pages on a huge touch screen is much easier
than shuffling paper.</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0209">The digital age has steadily driven down the demand in libraries for paper copies to levels that
make it increasingly difficult to justify copiers. KIC self-service scanning systems reduce copier
use further - to the point that attaching a small laser or ink jet printer is sufficient. KIC</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0210">systems also handle much larger materials than copiers, and they
scan books without damaging them. However, the most
compelling benefit of KIC over copiers is KIC's speed, due
mainly to its face-up scanning design, which is not only
significantly faster, but far easier to use.</p>

<h2 id="CCM-0211">Self-Serve Fax</h2>
<p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0212">KIC's huge touch screen and larger view screen make faxing extra easy. Users can compose,
review, clip, crop and change brightness and contrast of the pages of a fax before sending. KIC's
step-by-step process is designed for easy operation by even the most timid users. All you need is
an internet connection, and DLSG will provide the rest at a cost so low that fax revenue can pay for
the KIC system in a few years or less.</p>

<h2 id="CCM-0213">KIC Coins</h2>
<p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0214">Printing copies and faxing have per page costs that normally
must be passed on to the user. KIC has a free, built-in method
of charging users for copies and faxes.</p>
<p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0215">Simply print wallet-size "KIC Coins"
on regular letter-sized paper in any
denomination that you like, cut them
out, and sell them to users at the
circulation desk or wherever you
collect fees for late book returns.</p>

<h2 id="CCM-0216">KIC Compatible with Copy Card & Cash Systems</h2>
<p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0217">All KIC systems are compatible with all
standard copy card and coin-op devices.
Since KIC transfers images to users' computers
electronically, costly expendables
are avoided, even for color! The library
can opt to keep all revenue it collects.</p>
