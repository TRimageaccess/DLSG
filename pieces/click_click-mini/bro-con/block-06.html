<h1 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0601">True 2 Touch<span class="superscript">TM</span> User Interface</h1>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0604">Ease-of-use is a central feature of KIC. The KIC Click's large touch screen and its large "Scan" and "Save,
Send or Print" buttons that occupy a very large portion of the touch screen clearly convey how easy KIC is
to use. The Save button defaults to an output method and file format that is selectable by the institution.
If a flash drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it will save to the
flash drive. Users can override the default output method by manually selecting one or more alternative
methods of output.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0610">KIC's True2Touch<span class="superscript2">TM</span> User Interface,
Especially Forgiving for Beginners</h2>

<ul class="peppermint2" id="CCM-0611">
 <li>KIC is very agile, and allows the user to jump from just about anywhere
in the touch screen system to just about anywhere else, directly and
usually with a single touch. This modern, 'modeless' design is easier to
use, but difficult to create.</li>
 <li>KIC's large buttons and controls are easy to use, even for people with
unsteady hands.</li>
 <li>KIC gradually expands and contracts controls such as brightness, con- trast
and DPI so users can easliy follow their screen activity</li>
 <li>KIC doesn't delete original images when you clip a photo or excerpt of
text unless you tell it to.</li> 
 <li>KIC lets you output to many different destinations in a single session.</li>
 <li>Once you've scanned a document, you can change your mind as to
where you would like it to output. For example, you may have wanted
to save to USB, but learned your USB drive is full. Or you may scan
so much that it exceeds your email limit. Or after scanning and collating
a mass of research, you decide that you want to share the research
with others.</li> 
</ul> 

<h1 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0612">Two Large Screens for Simplicity & Power</h1>

<p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0613">It's easy to undervalue screen size. For 20 years, all cell-
phone makers relentlessly pursued smaller and smaller
screens until very recently when one company reversed that
trend. They realized that people want the largest screen that
will fit in their pocket/purse and hand. This is because dis-
play screens are our window to the digital world, and touch
screens give us control over that world.</p>

<p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0614">As big as self-serve scanning systems are, it makes sense
to have a very large touch screen. And with the low prices
for high quality displays, it is compelling to add a separate
display screen. In 2002, DLSG realized this, when the first
KIC system was designed. Today, with nearly 10 years more
experience than any other vendor, DLSG has the most under-
standable, easy to use and powerful user interface for self-
serve book scanning, and it's based on dual screens.</p>

<p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0615">The view screen shows very large, clear images of what
you've scanned, allowing the touch screen to have big, easy
to understand buttons and other controls.</p>

<p class="block_text4" id="CCM-0616">Display screens are our portals into the
digital world, and touch screens are the
easiest way to control that world. That's
why DLSG provides large, 24 inch,<br>
full HD displays and equally large touch
screens with most of its KIC systems.</p>
