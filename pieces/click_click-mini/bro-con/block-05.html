<h1 class="block-title6" id="CCM-0501">Beautiful Images - Fast and Easy, and Nondestructive</h1>
<h2 id="CCM-0502">Capture Deep into the Bookfold</h2>

<p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0503">KIC Click's Dual Cameras are Set at the Perfect Angles</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0504">Most books curve at the spine - some rather dramatically. KIC
Click gets deep into the bookfold of tightly-bound volumes
by capturing from two angles, and easily straightens out the
worst curves, producing clear, professional quality images.</p>

<h2 id="CCM-0505">Capture Area Comparison</h2>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0506">KIC Click's ample 16 X 22 inch capture area is over 50% larger
than that of 11x17 inch copiers and twice that of typical consumer
scanners. It handles a large percentage of books that are too big
for an 11x17 inch scan bed, scanning them two pages at a time
without damage to their spines.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0507">KIC Click's high speed is derived as much from its ultra-simple,
true two-touch interface as from its face-up design that obviates the
need to flip books over and over again during the capture process.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0508">KIC Click's sleek look and elegant design put the full KIC self-serve
digitization functionality into a mere 25 inch width. Its large, 22
inch touch screen and capture surface are at the perfect heights
for quick, standing operation when placed on a typical table or its
optional K-legs.</p>

<h3 id="CCM-0509">Fast, Face-Up Scanning that Captures<br>Into the Book Fold Like No Other Machine</h3>
<h3 id="CCM-0510">Thick Books...No Problem</h3>

<p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0511">KIC Click handles thick books beautifully.<br>
Text is clear and undistorted. KIC automatically adds<br>
margins for print-ready image quality.</p>

<h2 id="CCM-0512">Capture Oversized Books</h2>
<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0513">KIC Click Mini's generous 12.25 X 19.2 inch capture area is 27%
larger than that of 11x17 inch copiers and about twice that of typical
consumer scanners. It easily handles books that are too big
for an 11x17 inch scan bed, scanning them two pages at a time
without damage to their spines.</p>

<p class="block_text4" id="CCM-0514">Very large volumes can be scanned side-<br>
ways, one page at a time and rotated.</p>
