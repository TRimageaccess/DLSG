<h1 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0901">Your Choice: Scan Face-Down or Face-Up</h1>
<h3 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0902">Faster is also Easier</h3>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0903">Face-up book scanning is far easier on both patrons and
books and quite a bit faster than face-down scanning.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0904">Scanning books face-up makes it much easier to keep track
of what pages you've scanned. With KIC Click, Click Mini and
other face-up scanners, books stay face up, so you can see
what you're scanning as you scan it. This extra visibility elim- inates
the age old problem of skipping pages and scanning
pages out of order which can occur with face-down scanners.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0905">The following photo sequences show the reason that facedown
scanning systems are typically 1/3 the speed of faceup
systems. The book flipping necessary to scan a book
on a face-down scanner like the KIC BookEdge is shown in
the photo sequence below. It's a workout both for the book
and the patron.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0906">The ergonomic design of the face-up scanning sytems
involves only the basic movement required to set a book
down and turn a page.</p>

<p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0915">The sequence above shows just how much work is required
to use a face-down scanner to scan multiple pages.</p>

<p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0916">In contrast, the sequence on the left shows the relative speed
and ease of face-up scanning systems that do not require
the user to flip over the book being scanned. Once placing
the book, the user simply turns pages and presses the scan
button (or foot pedal) to scan two pages at a time.</p>

<h1 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0917">KIC Fleet Management</h1>
<h3 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0918">Monitor Usage Statistics at a Glance</h3>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0919">Control,update and monitor your KIC systems remotely. To
better serve your patrons, it is important to know which KIC
systems are used the most and at what times during the
day and week, and which are used the least. All usage statistics
can help you to determine the best KIC configuration
for each site. And to make it easier to navigate from KIC to
KIC system, KIC Fleet Manager allows you to select a particular
KIC system via either of two methods: a map or a list.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0920">With over ten years serving libraries, KIC is the most stable
product available today. However, DLSG engineers incessantly
work to improve KIC and support the growing changing
digital world. DLSG offers improved software re-</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0921">gularly, and in order to make it easier to deploy updates, KIC Fleet Manager lets you
update KIC systems remotely. For example, a recently released feature
lets you turn KIC systems on and off on demand or on a schedule set by a
central control panel.</p>
