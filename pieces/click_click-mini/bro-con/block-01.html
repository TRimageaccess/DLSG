<p class="block_text" id="CCM-0104">The KIC Click is a high-speed, face-up book capture system
at an affordable price. Its sleek and elegant look will
complement any library floor. And with its True2Touch<span class="superscript2">TM</span> user
interface, KIC Click is as easy to use as it is beautiful. Are
there any compromises? You decide.</p>

<p class="block_text" id="CCM-0105">The KIC Click captures nearly 20 book pages per minute for
instant access on tablets, notebooks, smart devices and easy
transfer to desktop PCs and servers. With a bed size 30%
larger than its nearest competitor, it captures up to 22 x16
inch books and materials at an uncompromising resolution of
300dpi.</p>

<p class="block_text" id="CCM-0106">Photocopiers, PCs, monitors and keyboards clutter up otherwise
beautiful libraries across America. The smooth but rugged black
or white KIC Clicks totally reverse that trend, adding beauty
to even the most beautiful libraries.</p>
