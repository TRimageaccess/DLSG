<h1 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0801">KIC Bookeye vs. Copiers - How KIC Compares</h1>
<h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0802">Copiers are Outmoded</h2>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0803">Since the first KIC was delivered to a library in 2004, the days
of photocopiers for patron use in libraries were numbered. And
now with the rapid explosion of tablet computers and electronic
readers, the demand in academic libraries for electronic copies
has substantially outstripped the demand for printed copies. The
demand for electronic copies in public libraries is also reaching a
tipping point.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0804">The ability to capture hundreds of pages of research into a tablet
or electronic reader and search through that material on the Inter- net
with a tablet, eReader or notebook PC that can be used just
about anywhere is highly convenient and immensely valuable. In
this digital age, academic libraries are compelled to go hybrid for
three reasons: 1) the high demand for digital content; 2) their ex- isting
print collections contain vast amounts of information that
cannot be found on the Internet; and 3) students are receptive to
the price of electronic copies - typically free.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0805">So how do the costs of KIC systems compare with those of photo
copiers? There are three main factors that keep the cost of photo- copies
high: 1) each copy requires paper, toner and ink; 2) photo-</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0806">copiers require a lot of maintenance due
to the number of moving parts; and 3) all
major photocopier brands use a distributed
service model.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0807">In contrast, these costs are lower for KIC
because KIC has split the scan/copy
functions into three separate machines,
choosing the best of breed for each. As a
result, KIC offers the best book scanners
by themselves or with a loose-leaf paper
(ADF) scanner. Virtually any off-the-shelf
laser or inkjet printer can be added to any
KIC system, so you can optimize costs
and speeds, and offer affordable color.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0809">Click vs. Copiers</h2>

<p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0810">This graph compares the total costs of one color KIC Click system with
two color copiers and with two black and white copiers. Both copiers are
the kinds typically seen in academic libraries. One KIC Click is compared
with two copiers because its face-up operation yields well over two times
the performance of a typical copier. The costs are broken into three main</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0811">areas: equipment and maintenance, consumables,
and patron usage time. With KIC Click, electronic output
is assumed to be preferred over print 90% of the
time. That ratio has ranged from 75-95% electronic in
2012, but is certain to rise in the future.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0812">No More Book Spine Damage!</h2>

<p class="block_text8" id="CCM-0813">Thick books with stiff spines and content that runs deep into
the bookfold are often damaged when copied. KIC Click
easily captures content without damaging book spines.</p>

<p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0814">KIC automatically removes black<br>
edges, straightens content, and<br>
produces clean, professional look-<br>
ing images - important for elec-<br>
tronic reserves, course curriculum<br>
materials and research reports.</p>

<p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0826">These automatic image treatment<br>
functions also save a lot of admin-<br>
istrator, faculty, and student time.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0815">Thick Books...No Problem</h2>

<p class="block_text4" id="CCM-0816">KIC Click & Click Mini handle thick books beautifully. Their<br>
contour-finding lasers allow it to flatten even the most curved<br>
books and produce text that is clear and undistorted. KIC<br>
automatically adds margins for print-ready image quality.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0817">Click Mini Scans 3 Times Faster</h2>

<p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0818">Statistics from five million scanning sessions across America re- vealed
a median session length of 23 pages. So, most of the time
spent during a KIC session is spent scanning. Face up scanning
has been proven to be three times faster than face down scanning.</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0819">So why is speed so important?</p>

<ul class="peppermint" id="CCM-0820">
 <li>It's economical. One Click can replace multiple copiers
or other face-down scanning machines.</li>
 <li>It gives patrons another reason to visit your library.</li>
 <li>It's green. The faster it is, the more use it will get and the less
the copier will be used.</li> 
</ul> 

<p class="block_text5" id="CCM-0821">In the digital world,
there is no paper,
toner or ink, so li- braries
rarely charge
for images, whether
black and white or
color.</p>

<p class="block_text5" id="CCM-0822">Over the years, many libraries experimented with
color copiers, but could never find a formula that
worked. If the fees were low, patrons would copy
materials with so much color that the library would
spend more on ink than the fees they were col- lecting.
If the fees were too high, the usage would
be so low that the cost of the machine couldn't be
justified.</p>

<p class="block_text5" id="CCM-0823">KIC calculates the amount of color in an image
before it is printed. So the fee for copies with a
little bit of color can be the same as the fee for
black and white copies. If a copy has a lot of color,
the fee can be increased in proportion to the cost
of the color ink or toner. This wonderful feature
should be a simple, easy byproduct of the digital
age, and it is with KIC.</p>
