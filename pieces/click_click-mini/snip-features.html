Unlike copiers and flatbed scanners, both KIC Click&trade; and Click Mini allow users to digitize books face-up, without damaging books by having to press them hard against a glass plate. 
The Click&trade;'s / Click Mini's lightening speed is derived as much from its fast opto-electronics as from the fact that its face-up design obviates the need to flip books over and over again during the digitization process.
