<h1 class="block-title" id="WF-0501">Opus Hierarchical Metadata Capture</h1>

<div>
<p class="block_text" id="WF-0502">Opus' hierarchical metadata capture is controlled by templates that can be created and modified to fit virtually any
requirements. Input field characteristics include: required/optional, repeatable/one occurrence only and other characteristics
that can be specified when templates are constructed or modified. Opus provides several generic templates to capture the
data necessary to create virtual library output formats.</p>

<p class="block_text" id="WF-0503">Opus provides a
straightforward graphical interface for creating and
modifying hierarchical templates. The templates
carry the characteristics of XML elements and
attributes. Data entry rules such as required/optional
and single/multiple can be assigned to each field.
During metadata capture and entry, Opus enforces
the rules, thus simplifying metadata entry and
reducing the possibility of errors.</p>

<p class="block_text" id="WF-0504">In addition, the Opus hierarchical metadata input facility allows a user to scroll back and forth through the images of
an object (e.g. pages of a book) while reviewing and entering metadata.</p>

<h1 class="block-title" id="WF-0505">Opus Collection Composer</h1>
<div>
<p class="block_text3" id="WF-0506">The first nine stages of Opus create normalized digital masters.<br>
The Opus Compose Collection facility withdraws objects from<br>
the stored normalized digital masters and publishes them to<br>
their final destination(s).</p>
<p class="block_text2" id="WF-0507">Composing collections couldn't be
easier. Select the digital volumes that comprise the desired digital
collection in minutes with Opus Collection Composer. Simply name
the collection and begin adding objects by browsing the digital
archives managed by Opus. A simple click of the mouse adds a volume to
the collection.</p>
<p class="block_text2" id="WF-0508">Digital archives are reusable assets,
especially when managed by Opus. Once you have created your
archive, you can use it anytime to compose and automatically create
new and different collections, course curriculum materials, etc. Online
digital content and print-on-demand add to the many digital formats.</p>
