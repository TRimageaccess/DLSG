Opus has a library of script files for common XML, flat file
and other output formats for the metadata and associated
images of digital objects (e.g. METS, MODS, Dublin Core).
This script library is expandable with an unlimited number of
custom formats. In addition to selecting the desired output
format(s) for the metadata, the clarity and output formats of
the images can be specified (e.g. TIFF,JPEG, PDF, PNG,
etc.).

DLSG staff technicians can assist in modifying existing
formats and creating new custom output formats.

The most exciting and immediately usable format that Opus
creates is a Web-ready output that provides the experience
of browsing the virtual stacks, selecting a digital book,
opening it and turning the pages; as though the printed
book were in front of you.
