<h1 class="block-title" id="WF-0301">Elements of Opus</h1>

<div>
<p class="block_header" id="WF-0302">Workflow Manager</p>
<p class="block_text" id="WF-0303">Opus Workflow Manager completely manages all objects
throughout the entire digitization process while allowing third
party software to be used where desired; provides tools for
monitoring all objects as they move through the digitization
workflow system to make managing projects and scheduling
workers a breeze; and minimizes the cost of rework, whether it
be skipped or improperly performed work, or even a change in
the fundamental rules governing a digitization project.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p class="block_header" id="WF-0304">Automatic and Manual Image Treatment</p>
<p class="block_text" id="WF-0305">Opus completely automates the Image Treatment processes
by separating two-up images, removing bookfold distortion, fan,
gutter, and skew; all in a single operation. Opus also provides
a streamlined graphical interface to manually perform the
specialized image treatment functions required for both digital
preservation and the various types of access.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p class="block_header" id="WF-0306">Integrated Hierarchical Metadata Capture</p>
<p class="block_text" id="WF-0307">Opus' Metadata Capture stages are not part of any digital
collection viewing software, but instead are built seamlessly
into the Opus digitization workflow system. The Opus Metadata
Capture stages allow users to select from a list of standard
hierarchical metadata templates, create new ones and restrict
users to a subset of templates for a given project. The templates
include metadata characteristics like requiring certain metadata
to be captured, allowing some types of metadata to be repeated
and requiring a single value for other types.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p class="block_header" id="WF-0308">State-of-the-Art Customizable Output Derivatives and
Formats</p>
<p class="block_text2" id="WF-0309">Opus' Create Collection stage provides output that</p>
<p class="block_text" id="WF-0310">can be imported into open source and proprietary content
management and digital library systems. Storage and internet
bandwidth requirements rise as image quality rises. Opus lets
the user select the ideal compromise for each access system
that collections are deployed to. If requirements change, simply
output the collection again with different clarity parameters.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p class="block_header" id="WF-0311">Automated Archival</p>
<p class="block_text" id="WF-0312">Opus adheres to the Open RAID standard. During the digitization
process, there are three points at which archival is necessary:
1) archival of images immediately after scanning and before
image treatment is performed; 2) archival of images after image
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p class="block_text" id="WF-0313">treatment has been performed; and 3) archival of metadata
after metadata has been captured. Opus creates archives that
are open architecture in formats that are accessible by today's
communities of users, and with the proper data migration plan,
will be accessible by its future communities of users.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p class="block_header" id="WF-0314">Data Migration Facility</p>
<p class="block_text" id="WF-0315">Opus provides an Archive Management and Data Migration
facility which is intended to be run periodically, before the
possibility of any media-related data loss becomes significant
and before the media or data formats become obsolete. Opus'
data migration facility runs unattended. While moving the data
to new media, it can convert images and/or metadata from its
existing standardized formats to new standardized formats,
ensuring that data is never lost and is always in a format that is
accessible by its community of users.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p class="block_header" id="WF-0316">Digital Collection Web Site Creator</p>
<p class="block_text" id="WF-0317">Opus provides Web-ready output that allows viewers to select
a volume, open it and navigate from section to section and from
page to page. A lifelike 3-D virtual page turning experience is
provided as well. Opus creates the image files, downloadable
PDFs, HTML, etc. including an entry point file called default.
html and places them in a folder. To deploy a Web-ready digital
collection, simply place the contents of the folder created by
Opus on a Web site server and link the default.html file to an
existing Web page. A thousand-book collection can be deployed
in little more than the time it takes to copy the data.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p class="block_header" id="WF-0318">Enlightened Architecture</p>
<p class="block_text" id="WF-0319">The Opus architecture originates from a clear understanding
of the core purposes of each element of digitization and
access systems. In the book publishing business, rarely are
books manufactured in the stores that sell them. Not only is
manufacturing separate from retail, but distributors exist to
attend to the specific needs of each of their stores while providing
a simple, consolidated relationship with book manufacturers.
In some cases, distributors provide warehousing services
and in other cases, product warehousing is performed by the
manufacturer. Opus serves as the manufacturer, warehouse
and distributor.
