Get into the game with Opus! Long have the complexity and high startup and operating costs of digitization
projects kept most libraries, museums and archives on the sidelines. Opus leverages today's highperformance,
low-cost computers to obliterate those barriers with its paint-by-numbers digitization system
that produces the highest quality digital collections possible at less than 1/3 historic startup and operating
costs. In as little as one day, Digital Library Systems Group (DLSG) installation and training staff will leave
you with a fully operational digitization system. Followon training sessions via the Web ensure that your staff
is producing multiple beautiful digital books per day in no time, complete with hierarchical metadata.

With the new low prices and high-performance of the latest book scanning hardware, complete digitization labs are surprisingly affordable.

The digital archives that Opus creates can be accessed without proprietary software. Using its Compose 
Collection and Create Collection capabilities, Opus can create an unlimited number of digital collections 
in nearly unlimited formats (derivatives) any time in the future. Simply select the desired volumes and 
data formats and let Opus create your collection(s) unattended overnight.
</p>
<p>
Opus' automated data migration facility makes it easy to transfer multiple copies of your digital archive to
new media every three to five years, ensuring that no data is ever lost. In addition, during data migration,
Opus will automatically convert from outdated data formats to any new standards that might emerge in the future.
