<h1 class="block-title" id="WF-0401">Opus Image Treatment</h1>

<div>
<p class="block_text" id="WF-0402">Opus takes the tedium out of image treatment by providing users with an interface that is wholly dedicated to processing
images for archive, preservation and access. Even problem images can be fully processed in seconds. Prior to manually
reviewing and adjusting images, Opus performs image treatment functions automatically. If any automatic image treatment
function requires additional adjustment, Opus allows the user to graphically 'assist' Opus and make adjustments in seconds.</p>
<p class="thumb_title" id="WF-0403">Skewed</p>
<p class="thumb_title" id="WF-0404">Skew Corrected</p>
<p class="thumb_title" id="WF-0405">Cropped Image</p>
<p class="block_text" id="WF-0406">Automatic image treatment removes skew, adjusts the border, and eliminates fan and gutter. The treated image
may be further refined by manual treatment.</p>
<p class="thumb_title" id="WF-0407">Book Curvature</p>
<p class="thumb_title" id="WF-0408">Book Curvature Corrected</p>
<p class="block_text" id="WF-0409">Book curvature produced from scanning tightly bound books may be realigned using Opus' sophisticated book
curve correction tool. Text and photos are returned to their original alignment and orientation.</p>
<p class="thumb_title" id="WF-0410">Too Dark</p>
<p class="thumb_title" id="WF-0411">Just Right</p>
<p class="thumb_title" id="WF-0412">Too Light</p>
<p class="block_text" id="WF-0413">Opus allows for the output of a large variety of derivatives. Controlling threshhold optimizes the clarity for each
type of derivative which, in turn, produces the highest quality image for that output request.</p>
<p class="thumb_title" id="WF-0414">Unwanted Artifact</p>
<p class="thumb_title" id="WF-0415">Artifact Removed</p>
<p class="thumb_title" id="WF-0416">Photostat</p>
<p class="thumb_title" id="WF-0417">Inverted Photostat</p>
<p class="block_text" id="WF-0418">Artifacts of all types may be removed from an image while
retaining the underlying variations in shading. Fingers,
blemishes, stains or even handwritten notes may all be removed
to produce an image that closely resembles the original. Opus
enables you to publish both the treated and untreated image.
<p class="block_text" id="WF-0419">Photostats and negatives are easily
inverted revealing an otherwise unreadable
document.</p>
