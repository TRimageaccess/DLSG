<div class="block-stage" id="WF-02-define">
<p class="stage-name">Define</p>
<p class="stage-body">The Define stage locks object-level metadata to each
volume prior to scanning via a barcoded tracking
sheet that is kept with the volume. The scan
operator simply scans the tracking sheet, then the volume. 
Metadata templates can also be selected in this stage.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-stage" id="WF-02-scan">
<p class="stage-name">Scan</p>
<p class="stage-body">The Scan stage supports virtually every type of scanner
at the highest quality possible, including ultra-large scanners
that produce ultralarge, multi-gigabyte images.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-stage" id="WF-02-raw_arch">
<p class="stage-name">Raw Archive</p>
<p class="stage-body">The first Opus Archive stage automatically archives raw, unmodified images
prior to any image treatment. Image treatment can be performed at any
time in the future with different parameters and new algorithms.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-stage" id="WF-02-auto_it">
<p class="stage-name">Auto IT</p>
<p class="stage-body">The Automatic Image treatment stage can determine book skew, create
consistent margins, eliminate book curve, fan and gutter, and smooth
backgrounds. Opus Image treatment functions are not limited by file size.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-stage" id="WF-02-manual_it">
<p class="stage-name">Manual IT</p>
<p class="stage-body">The Manual Image treatment stage provides for careful, quick review of each image
for scan quality and autoimage treatment results. Bad scans are flagged for rescan,
and image treatment problems are corrected with its very easy, efficient graphical interface.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-stage" id="WF-02-treated_image_arch">
<p class="stage-name">Treated Image Archive</p>
<p class="stage-body">The second Opus Archive stage automatically archives images treated by the prior
two stages. Multiple versions of treated images can be maintained.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-stage" id="WF-02-auto_metadata">
<p class="stage-name">Auto Metadata Capture</p>
<p class="stage-body">The Automatic metadata capture stage captures metadata that was specified in the
metadata template, stores it in a nonproprietary XML format and passes it to the Manual
Metadata Entry stage.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-stage" id="WF-02-manual_metadata">
<p class="stage-name">Manual Metadata Entry</p>
<p class="stage-body">This stage provides an intuitive hierarchical graphical interface for entering the metadata
specified in the object's template, from object level to page and sub-page level,
with an unlimited number of elements at each hierarchical
level.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-stage" id="WF-02-metadata_arch">
<p class="stage-name">Metadata Archive</p>
<p class="stage-body">The third and final Opus Archive stage automatically archives the captured and
keyed metadata in a non-proprietary format. Whenever objects are output by the Compose
and Create stages, the metadata is transformed to the desired output format.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-stage" id="WF-02-compose">
<p class="stage-name">Compose</p>
<p class="stage-body">The Compose stage allows unlimited numbers of digital collections to be exported repeatedly
with different image and metadata specifications. Each digital collection can include any number
of objects from the archive. Format, size, clarity and metadata can vary widely.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-stage" id="WF-02-create">
<p class="stage-name">Create</p>
<p class="stage-body">This stage provides unattended output of entire digital collections comprising
many volumes. Since image resizing, etc. can be very time intensive, this stage
can be performed overnight.</p>
