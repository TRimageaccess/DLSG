                KIC is an indispensable study and research tool that enhances reports and papers with crystal clear
                color and black &amp; white pictures, graphs, and excerpts from books, magazines and journals.
                In addition, as a UDSA compliant digitize-on-demand system conveniently located among the stacks, KIC
                can be used as an ad hoc digitization station by preservation, Archive and Interlibrary Loan
                departments.

                    KIC system scan a "two-up" page of a book,
                    analyze the single image, and automatically split

                    step that takes just 5 seconds.

                    In addition, the black edges are automatically

                    electronic reserves, course curriculum materials
                    and research reports. These automatic image treatment function can also save a lot of time for
                    faculty and administrators.

                The face-up scanning capability of KIC Bookeye 4 and KIC Click&trade; systems enables users to capture
                multiplepages far more easily than ever before -
                books no longer need to be flipped over to turn thepage and then flipped back over for each scan or
                copy.
                KIC systems scan up to ten times faster than a typical flatbed scanner and over twice as fast as a high
                speed copier.
                In addition, itproduces either color or black &amp; white images for the same cost, which equates to
                substantial savings.
                Finally, KICpromotes a cleaner environment by reducingpaper and toner use.

                        KIC's revolutionary True 2-Touch user interface is so intuitive that even the most inexperienced
                        users can immediately scan materials and save them on a USB thumb drive in minutes.

                        Ease-of-use is an essential feature of KIC.
                        The "Scan" and "Save, Send orprint" buttons occupy a very largeportion of the 17" touch
                        screen.
                        The "Save" button defaults to an output method that is selectable by the institution.
                        If a flash drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it
                        will save to the flash drive.
                        Users can override the default output method by manually selecting one or more other methods of
                        output.

                    KIC is also compatible with all standard copy card and coin-op devices.
                    Since KIC transfers images to users' computers via flash drives, email &amp; FTP, there need not be
                    any costly expendables ... none, even for color!
                    The library can opt to keep all revenue it collects.

                To fully earn the 'hybrid library' designation, a library'sprint collections must be available in
                digital format.
                KIC systems allow your students and faculty to select material for quick and easy self-serve
                digitization,providing a valuable conduit between yourprint collections andpatronpCs.
            </p>
            <p>
                KIC's self-serve digitize-on-demand capabilities leverage your library's most valuable assets.
                Digital images don't have the limitations ofphysical copies.
                They can instantly be shared with fellow researchers around the world via email, dramatically
                facilitating collaboration.

            <p>Higher education libraries across America hold $100 Billion in scholarly knowledge, the majority of which
                can't be found on the internet. This knowledge has been amassed through careful selection over many
                years and is augmented at substantial expense every year. And, thanks to U.S. copyright law, this
                knowledge is <strong>free</strong> to scan an unlimited number of times, or until the books
                disintegrate.</p>
            <img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/DLSG/images/CCM13People.png" alt="Click Click Mini People">
            <p>Because of this, hundreds of universities across America have added high-speed self-serve book scanning
                machines to their library floors; machines that create digital content at rates of 5 to 20 pages per
                minute. These self-serve Knowledge Imaging Centers are much gentler on books and produce higher-quality
                digital content than the paper reprints produced by paper</p>
            <p>copiers. The images can cost as little as 1&cent;
                per page and are readable on tablets &amp; smart phones as well as notebooks and regular PCs. The images
                can
                be printed at any time for those who still prefer hard copy.</p>
            <h3>So what's the problem?</h3>
            <p>Paper copiers are as necessary as ever in administrative areas across campus, but copier companies don't
                want to give up that one place they no longer belong, the library floor.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, book spines are being damaged, paper is being wasted, and students are not seeing their
                libraries as the vast free sources for scholarly knowledge that they are.</p>

                Fortunately, academic libraries exist to serve students. The first step is for students to inform the
                libraries as to just how important it is to switch from paper copiers to digital book scanners that can
                print if desired. The next step depends on circumstances at your particular institution. Every year,
                libraries spend many times more money on printed books and journals than the cost of an entire fleet of
                new high-speed scanners. But some libraries have no control ever any of that budget money. At these
                institutions, faculty specifies what is purchased. So, the library must use other funds to purchase
                these units. If yours is such an institution, it is especially important to convey just how much
                students value getting unlimited, free digital content from their libraries, and that it's worth the
                effort to scape together the necessary funds from various other budgets.</p>
            <p><img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/DLSG/images/CCM14Women.jpg" alt="Click Clikc Mini Women">
                Another means of acquiring KIC systems is to use student-administered funds (i.e. student technology
                funds.). These non-library funds can be used to purchase a pilot set of one small KIC, one medium KIC
                and one large KIC. Once they're in the library, their popularity with students will make it much easier
                to justify all the efforts necessary to piece together the funds and to tell the entrenched copier
                companies that the library floor is no longer their domain.</p>
            <p>Alternately a relatively small portion of these funds can be used to upgrade from basic copies
                replacement Knowledge Imaging Centers that scan 5 pages per minute to faster KIC systems that scan up to
                20 pages per minute.</p>
            <span>Should copier companies determine how one of your university's great resources is to be used?</span>
            <p><img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/DLSG/images/CCM14Copier.jpg" alt="Click Click Mini Copier">
                Should copier companies determine how one of your university's great resources is to be used? That is
                just what is happening in many universities. If your students want to go digital (digitize on demand),
                you may have to take it up with the university department that negotiated a campus-wide contract with a
                copier company and ask that the library floors be excerpted from the contract because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>copiers damage books and waste paper</li>
                <li>copiers are slower than scanners</li>

                            <p> The new WideTEK25
                                wide format flatbed scanner is the fully re-engineered successor to the WideTEK A2.
                                Doubling the
                                optical resolution, while offering the higher scanning speed, guarantees an
                                excellent image output.
                                The WideTEK25
                                can scan just about anything: from business cards to diagrams in A2 format, books,
                                newspapers, maps,
                                bound documents and more. The scanner needs only three seconds to scan the largest
                                format.
                            </p>
                            <p> Nearly all functions can be executed directly at the scanner via the integrated
                                touch screen.
                                The Scan2Net&reg;
                                technology from Image Access forms the basis of the innovative user interface:
                                intuitive to use via
                                web browser or touch screen,providing the operator with direct control
                                over practically every
                                scanner function. Using the touch screen display, up to 30 different (password
                                protected)
                                jobs can be defined and stored. This allows operators to create and store templates
                                and choose any
                                predefined location on one of the network drives as a target for the scanned
                                images.</p>
                            <p> The integrated walk-up scanning software makes the scanner a truly shared device. It
                                allows
                                the user to scan and send images to a specific destination such as a networkprinter,
                                any directory
                                in the network, or to a USB stick;
                                without having to work with a clientpC. Simply walk up, scan and store or send the
                                image, all through the use of the touch screen.</p>
                            <p> A further innovative feature of the WideTEK25 : All optical components are encapsulated
                                in a hermetically sealed camera box,
                                making it not only

                                We do a full scan into the scanner memory at full speed, without any stops. We

                                're the only scanner company that does that. Only the time between scanning and output

                                upon the transfer speed of the network and the computer, and even our transfer rate is
                                twice as fast
                                as competingproducts because data is transferred to your workstation at 1 Gigabit
                                speeds, while
                                other scanners use significantly slower transfer rates (1/2 Gigabit or less).
