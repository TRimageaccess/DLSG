    <meta name="description" content="Since 1993, Image Access has been providing digitization workflow solutions to commercial markets. Having developed its own OCR, barcode reading and image treatment algorithms, Image Access is capable of meeting virtually any and all specialized digitization needs.
Motivated by a great lineup of hybrid library products under development, Image Access created the Digital Library Systems Group (DLSG) in 2004; a division whose sole responsibility is the ongoing development, service and support of the best hybrid library digitization products possible at prices that virtually any academic or research library can afford.
Image Access U.S. remains focused on enhancing its digital library software products while Image Access Europe continues to develop new and better scanners.">
