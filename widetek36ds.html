                                The WideTEK 36 DS is the world's first wide format scanner for duplex digitization of
                                newspapers and other double-sided printed documents up to 36 inches (915 mm) in width.
                                This compact device needs only four seconds to scan the front and back sides of a
                                newspaper page (at 300 dpi).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The idea of double-sided scanning in one production step primarily means less production
                                effort:
                                The document no longer needs to be flipped over and scanned again on the other side.
                                That makes the scanner an ideal companion for press clipping, archiving and library
                                services.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The scanner features two camera boxes, both consisting of three CCD systems, integrated
                                into the upper and lower part of the device - only a few inches from each other.
                                The WideTEK 36 DS captures both sides of the newspaper at the same time. After scanning,
                                software separates the scanned document into four single images;
                                capturing the left and right sides on the front and back of the newspaper - all in a
                                single step.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The scanner is equipped with two processor units.
                                This allows an extremely fast data throughput.
                                The patented stitching procedure and the optical resolution of 1200 x 600 dpi guarantee
                                brilliant scan results.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The mechanical construction of the WideTEK 36 DS is also a highlight.
                                The more extensive mechanics and additional camera and light units were integrated into
                                the device without dramatically enlarging its dimensions.
                                The duplex scanner is only 13 centimetres larger than the compact WideTEK 36.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The complete camera optical system is integrated in a hermetically sealed housing.
                                Once optimally adjusted, it remains stable, dust-free and requires virtually no
                                maintenance.
                            </p>

                                pressure points; ensure the best possible gentle document transport.
                                WideTEK 36 DS digitizes even historical and fragile documents without damage to the
                                source document.

                            scanners always run at rated speeds regardless of how powerful your computer is. We do a
                            full scan into the scanner memory at full speed, without any stops. We're the only scanner
                            company that does that. Only the time between scanning and output are dependent upon the
                            transfer speed of the network and the computer, and even our transfer rate is twice as fast
                            as competing products because data is transferred to your workstation at 1 Gigabit speeds,
                            while other scanners use significantly slower transfer rates (1/2 Gigabit or less). <a

                            to less maintenance. We've even designed the case so that it works only with the WideTEK's
                            tools that ship with each unit.</p></div>

                            dpi. WideTEK's optics include multiple CCD arrays sealed in an airtight camera box for
                            dust-free and quiet operation. We've made it our business for over 15 years now to be
                            experts in image resolution, and since there is some confusion among users regarding this
                            matter, we've provided a white paper that debunks some longstanding myths. <a
